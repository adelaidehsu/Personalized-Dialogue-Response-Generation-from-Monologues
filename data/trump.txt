in the 1940s we saved the world.

then we saved the world again.
this time, from totalitarianism and communism.

democrats and republicans working together got mr.
gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.

unfortunately, after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course.
we failed to develop a new vision for a new time.
in fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.
logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.

each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper.

iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.

first, our resources are totally over extended.
president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy.
he’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders.
our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.

they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us.
in nato, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides america, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of gdp on defense.
we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia.

thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us.
we’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country.
he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry.
iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed.
remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.

president obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic.
he supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel, and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place.

fourth, our rivals no longer respect us.
in fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore.
the truth is they don’t respect us.

he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment.

the list of humiliations go on and on and on.
president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach.
our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea.
we have the leverage.
we have the power over china, economic power, and people don’t understand it.
and with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea, which is totally out of control.

finally, america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals.
since the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy.
one day, we’re bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians.
the next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart.
lives lost, massive moneys lost.

hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country.
after secretary clinton’s failed intervention in libya, islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans.
then, instead of taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep.

then, instead of taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep.
incredible.
clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie.
our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.
and, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning.
and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil.
and you know what? we don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it.
it’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.
this will all change when i become president.

to our friends and allies, i say america is going to be strong again.
america is going to be reliable again.
it’s going to be a great and reliable ally again.
it’s going to be a friend again.
we’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies.

we’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world.
our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge.
we need a new rational american foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — democrats, republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.

first, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam.
containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world.
events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the cold war.

in this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence, attacks and everything else.

we should work — thank you.
we should work — thank you.
we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam.
but this has to be a two-way street.
they must also be good to us.
remember that.
they have to be good to us, no longer one way.
it’s now two-way.
and remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them.
we’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them.
the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland.
there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism.
for every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more.
we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.
we have no idea where these people are coming from.
there’s no documentation.
there’s no paperwork.
there’s nothing.
we have to be smart.
we have to be vigilant.

a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or frankly, much worse.
all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than pearl harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.

secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy.
the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us.
our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal.
and it has to happen immediately.
our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today.
the navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time.
the air force is about one-third smaller than 1991.
pilots flying b-52s in combat missions today.
these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.

and what are we doing about this? president obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011.
our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.

it is the cheapest, single investment we can make.

but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely.
in this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem.
but i do.
no one dollar can be wasted.
not one single dollar can we waste.
we’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again.

this will ensure that our own workers, right here in america, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again.
so, so important.
we need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.

finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests.
businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries.
look at what happened in the 1990s.
our embassies in kenya and tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked.
and 17 brave sailors were killed on the u.s.s.

and what did we do? it seemed we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the united states.
frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda.
we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn’t do it

we need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies.
and believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them.
and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.

we have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries.

russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism.
i believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible.
common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon.
good for both countries.

china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.

after i’m elected president, i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies.
in these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges.
for instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade nato’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges, including migration and islamic terrorism.

our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.
the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.
with president obama and secretary clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.

our power will be used if others do not play by the rules.
in other words, if they do not treat us fairly.
our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand, i will enforce that line in the sand.

however, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct.
you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy.
a superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength.
although not in government service, i was totally against the war in iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east.
sadly, i was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been iran, who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.

that’s why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war.

look at my hands.
they’re fine.
nobody other than graydon carter years ago used to use that.
my hands are normal hands.
during a debate, he was losing, and he said, "oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means." this was not me.
this was rubio that said, "he has small hands and you know what that means." okay? so, he started it.
so, what i said a couple of days later ...
and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "mr.
trump, you have strong hands.
you have good-sized hands." and then another one would say, "you have great hands, mr.
trump, i had no idea." i said, "what do you mean?" he said, "i thought you were like deformed, and i thought you had small hands." i had fifty people ...
is that a correct statement? i mean people were writing, "how are mr.
trump’s hands?" my hands are fine.
you know, my hands are normal.
slightly large, actually.
in fact, i buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? no, but i did this because everybody was saying to me, "oh, your hands are very nice.
they are normal." so rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ...
now i was hitting him pretty hard.
he wanted to do his don rickles stuff and it didn’t work out.
obviously, it didn’t work too well.
but one of the things he said was "he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else." you can look it up.
i didn’t say it.
a hand with little fingers coming out of a stem.
like, little.
look at my hands.
they’re fine.
nobody other than graydon carter years ago used to use that.
my hands are normal hands.
during a debate, he was losing, and he said, "oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means." this was not me.
this was rubio that said, "he has small hands and you know what that means." okay? so, he started it.
so, what i said a couple of days later ...
and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "mr.
trump, you have strong hands.
you have good-sized hands." and then another one would say, "you have great hands, mr.
trump, i had no idea." i said, "what do you mean?" he said, "i thought you were like deformed, and i thought you had small hands." i had fifty people ...

 i don’t want people to go around thinking that i have a problem.
i’m telling you, ruth, i had so many people.
i would say 25, 30 people would tell me ...
every time i’d shake people’s hand, "oh, you have nice hands." why shouldn’t i? and, by the way, by saying that i solved the problem.
nobody questions ...
i even held up my hands, and said, "look, take a look at that hand."

i don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not.
he said, ‘donald trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ i didn’t say that.
and all i did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when christie made him look bad, i gave him the– a little recap and i said, and i said, and i had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because i thought he was going to faint.
and everybody took it fine.
whether it was presidential or not i can’t tell you.
i can just say that what he said was a lie.
and everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after i said that, they never did.
and then i held up the hand, i showed people the hand.
you know, when i’ve got a big audience.
so yeah, i think it’s not a question of presidential ...

the mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the pope, because they want to continue to rip off the united states, both on trade and at the border, and they understand i am totally wise to them.
the pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states.
he doesn’t see how mexican leadership is outsmarting president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.

for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.
i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current president.
no leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith.
they are using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.

we’re going to make it great again.
and, you know, i watched hillary’s speech and she’s talking about wages have been poor and everything’s poor and everything’s doing badly, but we’re going to make it — she’s been there for so long.
i mean, if she hasn’t straightened it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years.
it’s just going to become worse and worse.
she wants to make america whole again and i’m trying to figure out what is that all about.
make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again.

it’s so great to be in florida.
it’s so great to be at mar-a-lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.

i know it was a very tough night for marco rubio.
he had a tough night but he worked hard.
he spent a lot of money.
he is a lightweight, as i’ve said many times before.
but you know what? we’re going to go to florida, we’re going to spend so much time in florida.
we’ve got about a 20-point lead.
i know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they’re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires.
and frankly, i think that’s fine.
as far as i’m concerned, it’s fine.
and if he wins, they’ll have totally controlled — total control.
but he’s not going anywhere anyway, but we’ll see what happens.

the virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in florida.
remember, we have thousands of employees in florida, all along miami, doral and mar-a-lago and so many other places.
and it’s been an amazing place to invest.
it’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.

recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation.
i mean, our nation is in serious trouble.
we’re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed.
china is just taking advantage of us.
i have nothing against china.
i have great respect for china, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders.
our leaders don’t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much.
no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit.
it won’t be that way for long.
we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we’re going to redo those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty.

you look at countries like mexico, where they’re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border.
they’re destroying us in terms of economic development.
companies like carrier air conditioner just moving into mexico.
ford, moving into mexico.
nabisco, closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico.
we have to stop it, folks.
i know how to stop it.
we’re going to create jobs.

we’re going to lower taxes.
i have a plan that larry kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen.
we’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class.
the middle class has been forgotten in our country.
it really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of, but we’ve forgotten the middle class.
so we’re going to lower taxes.

you look at all the companies that are moving out.
when you see pfizer moving to ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they’re leaving.
they used to move from new york to florida, or they’d move from new jersey to someplace else, chris.
but now they’re moving from here —

but now they’re moving from here —
— not that many people are leaving new jersey.
but chris understands the problem, fully understands.
now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world.
we can’t let that happen.

we’ve lost our manufacturing jobs.

millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses.

i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders caterpillar.
and recently, he ordered komatsu tractors from japan because they’ve cut the yen.
they’ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for caterpillar to compete.
and i don’t want that to happen.
that’s not going to happen.
they shouldn’t be allowed to do it.

we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source.
we have great, great power.
the problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don’t know what they’re doing.
so we’re going to work very, very hard.

i’m so honored by this evening.
if you would’ve told me on june 16th, when i was with my wife, melania, and we came down the escalator in trump tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this.
you have a lot of cameras here tonight.

it looked, literally, like the academy awards.
i never saw so many cameras in my life.
and it takes courage to run.
i’ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president.
i’ve never done this before.
i’ve been a job-producer.
i’ve done a lot of things but this is something i’ve never done, but i felt we had to do it.
when you look at the incompetence of the iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing.
when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted.
we’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.

so it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.
and if you want, press, i think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.
so it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight.

yes, go ahead.

well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.
well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.
but let me just explain something.
if you’ve seen what’s happened, whether you go to south carolina, where i had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire, tremendous in nevada, you look at what’s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all.
i mean, right now, they’re projected i guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states.
it’s georgia, alabama, massachusetts — (cheers) — tennessee, virginia.
and you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more.
in fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.
but let me just explain something.

and you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more.
in fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.
but i will say this.
look, we have expanded the republican party.
when you look at what’s happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in.
they came from the democratic party, or the democrat party, and they’re democrats and they’re long-time democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched.
and they were independents.
and we’ve actually expanded the party.
look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example.
four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes.
we doubled it.
we were almost 800,000.
whereas the democrats went down.
there’s much less enthusiasm for the democrats.
but i will say this.

so i — look, i’m a unifier.
i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, i am a unifier.
once we get all of this finished, i’m going to go after one person, that’s hillary clinton, on the assumption she’s allowed to run, which is a big assumption.
i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run.
and i think that’s, frankly, going to be an easy race.
you see the polls.
i beat hillary in many polls.
i know one thing.
i don’t think marco is going to be able to beat her.
i don’t think — in all fairness, i think ted’s going to have a very hard time.
but ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit.

so i just tell you this.
we are going to be a much finer party, a much — we’re going to be a unified party, i mean, to be honest with you.
and we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening.
we’re going to be a much bigger party.
our party is expanding.
and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i’ve won and just look — we’ve gone from x number to a much larger number.
that hasn’t happened to the republican party in many, many decades.
so i think we’re going to be more inclusive.
i think we’re going to be more unified and i think we’re going to be a much bigger party, and i think we’re going to win in november.
ok, yeah?
so i just tell you this.

ok, yeah?
i’m just doing what’s right.
look, planned parenthood has done very good work for some — for many, many — for millions of women.
and i’ll say it and i know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that’s really — because i’m a conservative, but i’m a common-sense conservative.
but millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood.
but we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned parenthood, and we understand that and i’ve said it loud and clear.
but — and we’ll see what happens.
but planned parenthood — millions of people — and i’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped.
and this wasn’t a setup.
this was people writing letters.
i’m going to be really good for women.
i’m going to be good for women’s health issues.
it’s very important to me, very important to me.
i’m just doing what’s right.

 and maybe that’s not a perfect conservative view, but i can tell you one thing.
i’m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you’re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.

so sarah, i mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but i am a truth-teller and i will tell the truth, ok?
so sarah, i mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but i am a truth-teller and i will tell the truth, ok?
yeah, go ahead, finish it.
yeah, go ahead, finish it.
i feel awfully good.
i mean, i’m watching your people — i’m watching your people on — and i’m going to be very nice, i’m going to be very nice — i’m watching your people on cnn and i’m watching the fox people and i’m watching the msnbc people, too, ok? see? i’m becoming diplomatic.

and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight.
i mean, you know, they’re being very strong.
and they are, they’re declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night, which is true.
he didn’t win anything.
he hasn’t won anything, period.
and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight.

and they are, they’re declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night, which is true.
he didn’t win anything.
he hasn’t won anything, period.
and by the way, and i have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty.
i’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty.
he hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.
and by the way, and i have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty.
i’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty.
he hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.
but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and it’s a big get.
now i also did very well in texas.
i came in second.
and one of the things my son, eric, told me, which i didn’t even realize, is that not only did i win most of the states — and some are coming in and i’m expected to win them — but i came in second — i came in no worse than second.
so it wasn’t like i won and then i disappeared.
the worst i had was a second.
so i’m very, very honored by the turnout, ok?

yes, go ahead.
yes, go ahead.
right.
oh, they’re totally wrong.
look, i disavowed.
i disavowed when i — in fact, chris is my number one — chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign.
he called me.
he said, "donald, what you’ve got is a movement." we spoke today in kentucky.
you’ve never seen a crowd like that.
that had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible.
and every place we’re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group.
we had 35,000 people the other day in alabama.
and when chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like i’ve never seen.
and in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing.
they’ve never seen what’s happening right now.
they’ve never seen anything like it.
and i’m just honored by it.
right.
oh, they’re totally wrong.

and i’m just honored by it.
now, when chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question.
i said i disavow.
now, right after the program that we’re talking about — and i thought it was clear, but you know, we’re talking about groups, groups, groups.
i do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? i mean, they have to give me the name of the group.
but right after, when i reviewed it, i put out a tweet and i put out on facebook that i totally disavow.
now everybody knew i did that but the press refused to look at that.
it was right after.
and i disavowed then; i disavowed today on abc with george stephanopoulos, i disavowed again.
i mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? but i disavow and hopefully it’s the final time i have to do it.
but if you look at facebook and if you look at twitter, right after the show i put out a statement because i want everybody to be sure.

yes, go ahead.
yes, go ahead.
no, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation.
it’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the american people.
no, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation.
it’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the american people.
so you know, look, you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he’s done executive order, executive order.
it’s almost like, i don’t even know.
does he ever go a deal with congress anymore? does he ever speak to the senate? does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?

you know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that i — is very, very important to me; corporate inversion.
carl icahn, who’s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he — it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we’re losing companies.
and we’re losing for two reasons.
we’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high.
we have the highest — we’re the highest taxed nation in the world.

and very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country.
the democrats agree it should be brought back in.
the republicans agree it should be brought back in.
everybody agrees it should be brought back in.
i could sit in a room — or the oval office — for a period of, literally, a half hour and i really believe i could get everybody — every single — you know, it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight.
here’s something every single — i mean, almost everybody agrees.

the president can’t make a deal.
the reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal, probably doesn’t work at it, probably doesn’t care, but you’re talking about tremendous number of — tremendous amounts of money.
so when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal, there’s something going on that’s really wrong.
and what it means is you have the wrong leader.

well, look, everything — we are going to have a wall.
i can tell you we are going to have a wall.
i watched the ex-president of mexico, the arrogance of this man.
and i get along great with hispanics.
you saw in nevada, i won in the poll, the hispanic vote.
i have thousands of people that work for me right now that are hispanic.
i’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime.
these are great people.
the mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it.
vincente fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have — if i ever used that word you folks would’ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it.
nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word.
but he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall.
mexico is going to pay for the wall.
we have a trade deficit with mexico of $58 billion a year — $58 billion.
the wall is going to cost $10 billion.
it’s so easy.
i’ve had these guys that i’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean mexico is going to pay for the wall.
one — as sure as you’re standing there, 100 percent, mexico’s going to pay, 100 percent.

and the reason is i’m a businessman.
i know how to do this.
politicians are all talk, no action.

it’s not going to happen with these people.
so when you think of it — and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall.
well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles.
the great wall of china, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have caterpillar tractors, because i only want to use caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or john deere.
i buy a lot of equipment from john deere.
i love john deere, too.
but they didn’t have tractors.
they didn’t have cranes.
they didn’t have excavation equipment.
the wall is 13,000 miles long.
we need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials.
we can do that so beautifully.
and this is going to be a serious wall.
this is going to be high wall.
this is going to be a very serious wall.

we’re going to stop drugs from coming into new hampshire.
you know, when i won new hampshire, those people were so incredible to me.
and when you go, you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so bucolic, so beautiful.
you look at the fields and you look at everything, it’s so beautiful.
and yet, you go to a meeting in new hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine.
the heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted.
and i told them i’m going to stop it.

and by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country, but they’re going to come in legally, ok?
i’ve got to find out what’s going on.
we’ve got a big problem.
we have a big, big problem.
i’ll tell it like it is.
we have a big, big problem.
we’ve got to figure it out.
we’re going to figure it out.
radical islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us.
you take a look at germany, you take a look at sweden, you take a look at brussels.
you look at some of these places, it’s like a disaster.
and we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they’re young and they’re strong.
you look at that migration line; they’re young, they’re strong, they’re powerful.
and you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country?

now, with all of that being said, i feel strongly — i have a bigger heart than anybody.
we’re going to build a safe zone.
it’s going to be in syria.
and i’m going to get the gulf states, who have more money than anybody — we’ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit.
we’re going to get — but they’re not accepting people.
we’re going to get — wait, wait, wait.
we’re going to get the gulf states to pay for it because they should.

oh, we’re going to bring them back.
we’re going to bring them back.
look, i’m telling you — you know how i’m going to bring them back? first of all, we’re going to do great with the african- americans, and you see that in the polls where i had in one poll where i’m 25 percent.
and one of the commentators, who i think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if donald trump gets 25 percent of the african-american vote, this election is over.
you watch.
and the reason i’m getting that — and i’m going to do great with the hispanics.
i’m going to do great with virtually every group.
the reason is i’m going to bring jobs back.
i’m going to get apple to start making their computers and their iphones on our land, not in china.
how does it help us when they make it in china?
oh, we’re going to bring them back.
we’re going to bring them back.

well, look, i always liked marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile.
he decided to become don rickles, ok? but don rickles has a lot more talent.
honestly, i did, i always liked him but he became — you know, somebody told him you’re losing very badly.
the only way you can possibly win, take the hail mary, they called it a hail mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile.
it’s hurt him.
in fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent.
it’s really hurt him.

but look, i’m not going to tell him what to do.
i’m not going to tell anybody what to do.
you have to run.
he had a bad night, according to cnn, fox.
i watched their broadcasts.
they say the loser of the night was marco rubio and it’s true.
he didn’t win anything.
he hasn’t won.
i mean, at least you can say that ted has won something, and you know, marco has not won.
you’ve got to be able to win.
you can’t talk.
you know, these politicians, all talk, no action.
you’ve got to be able to win something.
he hasn’t won anything.
and he actually hasn’t come very close.
so we’ll see what happens.

yes, go ahead.
yes, go ahead.
i’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble.
our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports.
i go throughout the world.
i mean, you go to qatar, you go to — some people say qatar, but you go to qatar, you go to any of — so many places.
you go to different places in china, different places in asia, different places in the middle east, you look at some of the airports they have.
you look at the roadways they have.
you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have.
we’re like a third world country.

so i am going to be very good for the world.
i’m going to get along with the world.
you’re going to be very proud of me.
even you will be very proud of me as a president.
but we have to rebuild our country.
our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that.

and hillary clinton doesn’t have a clue.
she can’t do that.
she’s talking about — i mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, i think one of the reasons i have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today — less money than they made 12 years ago.
and in her speech, she just said they’re making less money.
well, she’s been there with obama for a long period of time.
why hasn’t she done anything about it? practically everything that she was complaining about — she’s picked up what i say.
the difference is she’s been there for a long period of time.
why haven’t they done anything about it?

then you look at her record as secretary of state.
it’s abysmal.
you look at what’s going on with syria.
you look at what’s going on with everything.
it’s a disaster.
then you look at her record as secretary of state.
it’s abysmal.

so we’re going to have an interesting period of time.
i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run.
what she did is a criminal act.
if she’s allowed to run i would be very, very surprised.
but if she’s allowed to run, honestly, it’ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong.
and what she did — (cheers) — let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.

ok, one or two more questions.
yeah, go ahead, jeremy
ok, one or two more questions.
yeah, go ahead, jeremy
at this moment, absolutely not, no.
we either have a country or we don’t.
we have a country, or we don’t.
we have borders or we don’t have borders.
and at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.

well, look, i don’t expect — i have a lot of respect for reince and for the group and i like the rnc and i don’t know that i’ve been treated fairly or not.
i really don’t know.
i can’t tell you that.
but i can tell you that i do respect them.

i really don’t know.
i can’t tell you that.
but i can tell you that i do respect them.
what i really have is a great number of people.
i have millions and millions of people.
and when i was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before i came in here because i wanted to see exactly where we were before i started speaking, i was amazed at the kind of numbers.
the republicans have tremendous energy.
the democrats don’t.
they don’t have any energy.
their numbers are down.
our number are through the roof.
and people are making the statements they’ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.

i think if somebody is doing as well as i’m doing — and i’m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else — but if i’m going to win five — i’ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine.
it could be nine, could win nine states tonight.
if i’m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if i’m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that i might not win, i think, you know, we’re a democracy.
i think it’s awfully hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party, right? you know, it’s very hard.
i think if somebody is doing as well as i’m doing — and i’m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else — but if i’m going to win five — i’ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine.

i think it’s awfully hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party, right? you know, it’s very hard.
but i really think that — i think it’s a great question, david, because i really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the republican party has become more dynamic.
it’s become more diverse.
we’re taking from the democrats.
we’re taking from the independents.
we have a lot more people.
we have a lot more people.
i mean, take a look at south carolina.
look at the numbers.
look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote.
and then you look at — i was there and you had lines that went a mile long.
and it was virtually more than doubled.

so we have a very, very dynamic party and i think we’re going to be able to unify the party.
i hope to be able to get along with everybody.
i don’t know paul ryan well but i hope to be able to get along with him.
i do know mitch mcconnell a little bit but i hope to be able to get along with him.
but remember this.
i have millions and millions and millions of people.
this isn’t like it’s a close match.
i mean, it’s only too bad that winner didn’t take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over.
we’re just having a celebration.
so we have a very, very dynamic party and i think we’re going to be able to unify the party.

we’re just having a celebration.
you know, we’re having a celebration.
you know, we’re having a celebration.
so anyway, i would like to — look, i just want to end by thanking everybody.
this has been an amazing period in my life.
my wife just called and ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she’s a special person and it’s going to be great and we look forward to that.
she’s back in new york.
she wanted to be here.
they all wanted to be here but they’re with ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week.
but this this has been an amazing period of time.
it’s been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint.
and i think, honestly, we’ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and i’m very proud of it.

i am a unifier.
i would love to see the republican party and everybody get together and unify.
and when we unify, there’s nobody, nobody that’s going to beat us.

this is a movement.
no matter where we go, it’s amazing.

and they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, "go home." we’ll come back.
we’ll do another one.
but they had to go home.
would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in? no?

would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in? no?
i don’t think so, but we — they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually.
so maybe next time.
i don’t know.
i think this is the largest room.
i know it’s a record for the room.
i don’t think so, but we — they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually.
so maybe next time.
i don’t know.
i think this is the largest room.
i know it’s a record for the room.
you know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they’re standing.
they’re not sitting.
so that’s great.
i love — we love setting records.
we want the country to set records, right?
you know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they’re standing.
they’re not sitting.
so that’s great.

our leaders are stupid and — and/or — you have to say and/or they have deals, because what’s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do — our leaders, can you believe our leaders? this is what — but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don’t even want to do because they’ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.

i look at this guy jeb bush.
he spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave.
he is nowhere.
no, no.
think of it.
it’s got to be much more than that.
it was actually $59 million a while ago.
every time i turn on an add, i see an ad about trump.
i mean, it’s not that bad an ad either.
it’s like — you know.

if you’re going to do an ad, do an ad.
but he’s a low-energy person.
let’s face it.
we don’t need low-energy.
we need lots of energy.
if you’re going to do an ad, do an ad.
but he’s a low-energy person.
let’s face it.
we don’t need low-energy.

you probably saw i’m going to spend — now, we’re going to start spending a lot of money because i don’t want to take any chances.
you know, it’s — i love getting up — and for the last couple of months, i have been leading from practically the time i announced, right? and for the last — and leading a lot.
i’m going to go over that because i go over (ph) polls.

now, when they — if they turn negative, i don’t like them.
and i promise, if they turn negative, i’m not going to be talking about them.
in fact, i get criticized all the time.
you’re always talking about your polls.
one of these guys just got two.
he’s at two.
i’m at 42.
and one of these guys who’s at two said, "he always talks about his polls and i don’t." i wouldn’t either if i had two, i swear i wouldn’t.

i wouldn’t.
i wouldn’t do it at all.
but you know, i love to tell the story where i have spent nothing and bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that.
that’s just — you know, because i see since then — i mean, just — you can’t turn on this television without these commercials.
and fox — every two minutes it’s a commercial on trump.
i wouldn’t.
i wouldn’t do it at all.

and fox — every two minutes it’s a commercial on trump.
you know what he did? it’s false advertising.
so i killed him in the debate.
according to reuters, according to everybody, drudge, who’s an amazing guy, by the way.
if you don’t know drudge — matt drudge.
right? he’s a great guy.
but drudge, 46 percent.
at 46 percent, you have 15 people.
now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out.
a couple or more.
you know what he did? it’s false advertising.

we have washington times at 62 percent.
cbs, 59 percent.
fox, 62 percent — fox las vegas, 62 percent.
so, they all say — then they go back home, after the debate.
i like to see how did i do? did i look good? looking good is very important, right? sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it’s how did you look?
no, you know, it is amazing.

oh, i looked good, didn’t sound too good, but that is ok.
you wonder if that is a good trait.
but i go home, and i watch, and the pundits will say — and they can’t totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what’s happening — well, mr.
trump was ok tonight.
he was — i won every single online poll, i won.
oh, i looked good, didn’t sound too good, but that is ok.

trump was ok tonight.
he was — i won every single online poll, i won.
and then, here’s bush.
so, bush does an ad.
and he takes me — and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage — and then i killed him.
i mean, he — by the way, i met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got.
he came in last.
and then, here’s bush.
so, bush does an ad.
and he takes me — and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage — and then i killed him.
i mean, he — by the way, i met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got.
he came in last.
he takes the ad — and i shouldn’t even talk about him.
he’s down to two or three — i — but it bothers me when i see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? i say, why is he doing this? doesn’t he have something better, he should go home.
he takes the ad — and i shouldn’t even talk about him.
he’s down to two or three — i — but it bothers me when i see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? i say, why is he doing this? doesn’t he have something better, he should go home.
just relax.
you know, honestly, he should go home and relax.
he shouldn’t be wasting his time.
but it does.
i say, why is this guy spending all this money? now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere — but here is my ad.
so, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great.
he took on trump, he took on trump.
i’m standing here, he’s over here.
took on trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster.
you know? so, he would remember (ph) it.
just relax.

he said, "mr.
trump, why don’t you this?" i said, ok.
then i gave him an answer.
i said, "jeb, i’m at 42, you are at 2.
right? it is a simple answer.
you started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage.
right?
he said, "mr.

right?
no, no, it’s true.
and then — and then — and that was it.
and so i responded.
so, he asked me a question, question was fine.
you know, professionally written.
so, he asked me a question, good.
i give him an answer, i blow him away.
right.
everyone says trump won the debate.
everybody.
and hat is it.
so, the ad is him asking the question and i’m standing there like this, because i haven’t — in fact, you see in one of them, i’m just about ready to open my mouth.
no, no, it’s true.
and then — and then — and that was it.

but he doesn’t let me respond.
that is almost false advertising, isn’t it? you know? so, i mentioned it, hillary is a disaster.
i mean, hillary.
but he doesn’t let me respond.
that is almost false advertising, isn’t it? you know? so, i mentioned it, hillary is a disaster.
i mean, hillary.
hillary is controlled by her money.

i’m self-funding.
hillary is controlled by her money.
so is jeb.
so is — by the way, i’m the only one self-funding my campaign.
i’m self-funding.
you know, one of the things that makes me happy.
i heard one of my commentators this morning, said, "you know, i’ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and i’ve never seen anything like what has happened with trump.
one of them actually said — one of them — i’m special.
you’re special.
i like you.

isn’t that nice? that’s a very — every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you.
where are you? who said that? wow.
so nice.
thank you.
that is a nice one.
that’s like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal.
i think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?

low-energy can be applied to hillary.
i just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies.
right? because i consider them enemies.
we view this as war.
don’t we view this as war? it’s war.

i just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies.

and so, you don’t like to use it.
i hate to give it up.
what?
 how are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?
 how are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?
oh, we are going to help your daughter.
we are going to help the country, that’s called helping the daughter.
we are going to help your country.
so, here is the story.
so, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared.
general odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember.
and i think he went back tot he beginning, but let’s say second world war.
ok? that’s enough.
oh, we are going to help your daughter.

and i think he went back tot he beginning, but let’s say second world war.
ok? that’s enough.
and we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us.
she has done a terrible job as secretary of state.
think of it.
putin comes out, he said, donald trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack.
ok, that’s nice.
and we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us.
she has done a terrible job as secretary of state.
think of it.
putin comes out, he said, donald trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack.
ok, that’s nice.
 and she and my opponents — oh, isn’t it terrible that putin said — wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world? wouldn’t it be? seriously.
no, no, wouldn’t it be nice?
 and she and my opponents — oh, isn’t it terrible that putin said — wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world? wouldn’t it be? seriously.
no, no, wouldn’t it be nice?
i mean, they want me to refute his statement.
how dare you say i’m brilliant? how dare — that’s — who’s going to do that? and by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.
i mean, they want me to refute his statement.
how dare you say i’m brilliant? how dare — that’s — who’s going to do that? and by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.
but the point is, we have to get along.
the world has blown up around barack obama.
but the point is, we have to get along.
the world has blown up around barack obama.
now, i don’t know if you saw his recent release.
they were talking about the department of state, state department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they’ve done.
well, they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good? and they said bringing peace to syria.
did you see that?
now, i don’t know if you saw his recent release.

well, they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good? and they said bringing peace to syria.
did you see that?
so instead of saying they made a mistake — call it a typo, they made a mistake — they’re trying to justify it.
well, we meant we’re working on it.
can you believe — bringing peace to syria.
the world is blowing up, the migration in syria — they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to syria, and the whole world’s talking about it.
it’s — the level of stupidity is incredible.
i’m telling you.
i used to use the word incompetent, now i just call them stupid.
so instead of saying they made a mistake — call it a typo, they made a mistake — they’re trying to justify it.

i went to an ivy league school, i’m very highly educated.

i have — but there’s no better word than stupid.
i went to an ivy league school, i’m very highly educated.

i have — but there’s no better word than stupid.
right? there is none.
there is none.
right? there is none.
there is none.
there’s no — there’s no — there’s no word like that.
so we are going to turn things around.
but — and if we have hillary — i’ve got to tell you.
i just saw where for the last week she’s been hitting me really hard with the women card, ok? really hard.
and i had to say ok, that’s enough, that’s enough.
and we did a strong number.
she’s not going to win.
any by the way, i love the concept — i love, love, love having a woman president.
can’t be her.
she’s horrible.
she’s horrible.
there’s no — there’s no — there’s no word like that.

let’s do ivanka.
 and you know really don’t — i’ll tell you who does not like — yeah, we’ll get ivanka.

but i’ll tell you who doesn’t like hillary are women.
women don’t like hillary.
i see it all the time.
and always so theatrical; mr.
trump said this and that and this.

i just have to turn off the television so many times.
she just gives me a headache.

but you know — although i think last night i gave her a big headache.
but you know — although i think last night i gave her a big headache.
i can imagine — i can imagine those discussions.
but you have to hit back hard, and you can’t let them push you around.
and today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name.
you know, in the debate i was mentioned nine times, i mean everything.
all of them.
but her.
i was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned.
and then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense.
and — but she’s playing that card.
and then i had to hit her back, so i hit her back and i talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse — no, it’s tremendous abuse.

i mean, you look at it, it’s tremendous abuse.
and i talked about that.
and now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn’t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else.
i wonder why — i wonder why.

and i talked about that.
and now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn’t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else.

and remember this; it’s really important.
a poll just came out where we’re tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, fox, where i’m leading by four or five points against her individually.
we’re doing great.
i haven’t even focused on her yet.

look at the people i’ve focused on.
i don’t want to really knock them, i don’t want to mention their names.
but, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me.
wouldn’t it be nice if our country could have that same thing? you attack and they’re, boom, gone.
and if we could do it verbally —

and we’re going to take care of our vets, we’re going to take care of our vets —
 and it will cost you much less money, and it will be great.
i mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, you know that.
and you are paying for it.
and you will never ever use them.
so we will get that straightened out.
we are going to straighten a lot of things.
we are going to straighten out common core.
common core is dead.
it’s going to be dead.

 when i look at parents and i see local parents in iowa and new hampshire and south carolina, i went to a school and i saw the parents, they love their children.
they want that — they want education.
they love — they don’t care about money, they don’t care about anything.
they love their children and it’s local.

and they get together and they do wonderful programs.
they are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in washington.
i mean, we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it.
so, obamacare, dead.
common core, gone.
we are going to get rid of it.
department of education, we are going to get rid of it.

department of education, we are going to get rid of it.
 we are bringing education to a local level.
one thing on education.
so, in the world, we are ranked number 28.
there are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things.
and yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far — there is nobody close.
number two isn’t even close.

and yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far — there is nobody close.
number two isn’t even close.
so we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially.
i mean, it’s — can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1? and that’s what i do like saying about my campaign, i spent less money than anybody else and i have the best results.

i’m number one by a lot and i spent no money.
i mean, my plane cost me some money, but i spent no ads.
took a little radio ad in iowa.
but i didn’t do that — i took — i think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth.
but i spent essentially no money.

and then you have all these other guys spending vast — and they like the way the united states is run.
now, why would we put a guy like jeb, like some of the others.
it’s not only jeb bush.
they spend money.
i see rubio on the ads all day long.

he’s got like a black thing.
he should have put something like that behind him, right? right there, the flag.
 no, no.
and i like him.
i think he is a nice guy.
but i see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber.
it’s not — i don’t think it’s good.
so, think of it.
i spent no money and i’m number one.
others spent — they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race.
that’s what we need for our country.
what? ok.
i’ve got 15,000, i don’t know what the hell he means by that but that’s ok.
so, but i think he’s a fan.
i don’t think he’s a — are you a protester? no.
ok.
no body likes trump.
ok.
he’s not a protester.

i said, i had 20,000 people.
she said, they didn’t show it.
they have it right on your face.
so i have 20,000 people.
i have 20,000 in oklahoma, 35,000 in mobile, alabama.

you know, i think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe — except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it’s like.
they don’t even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.

and i like it because then it shows how big the crowds are.
so, you know.
some time i think i’m going to put in some false protesters.
i’ll put in some friendly protesters.
it’s the only way i’m going to be able to get the crowd in.

i talked about a lot of things.

and, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate.
we have the largest audience in the history of cable television.
then cnn a couple of weeks later had 23 million.
fox had 24 million.

now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted — they didn’t want the debates.
i think they were forced to take them for licensing.
nobody wanted the debates.
they drew nothing, but now they’re drawing 24 million.
now they want to have more debates — "oh, can we have more? can we have more?" can they go three hours?

do you remember when they had the one go three hours? i said, no, i’m not doing three hours.
it’s too long.
who wants — i could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?

"mr.
trump, you have 30 seconds.
what would you do about isis?" oh, great.
and by the way, that question — i hate those questions.
you know why? because i want to be unpredictable.
i don’t want to tell isis what i’m going to do to knock the hell out of them.

remember, i said very strongly — (inaudible) the oil for what, four years? you’ve been watching.
i mean, four years.
i’ve been "get the oil, get the oil, get the oil." because who’s going to get the oil? iran is taking over iraq.
we made a deal for iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side.
we gave them everything.
they — we don’t even get our prisoners back.

and now iran wants to start negotiating separately for them.
can you believe it? i go crazy.
we would have gotten them back.
all you had to do was say, "we want our prisoners back." they would have said no.
i would have said, "i want them back; you don’t understand me.
i want them back." they would have said, "no, we won’t do that." i would have said, "bye-bye," and i would have left.
then i would have doubled up the sanctions.
and i guarantee you...

...
i guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they’ll say, "you’ve got your prisoners; can we talk?"
and i would have never given them $150 billion.
i would have never given them the money.
i would have never give — they’re using it — they don’t have to make nuclear.
they can buy it.
why are they going to make it? then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections.
how about the area — you know, the big area? they don’t want us there.
oh, i wonder why.
they don’t want us there.
so they self-inspect, ok?

"we think you’re making nuclear weapons here." "well, let us go check, mr.
president, we’ll check."
then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty.
"we think you’re making nuclear weapons here." "well, let us go check, mr.

"no, sir, we’re not making nuclear weapons.
nobody — no, we’re not; we would never do a thing like that."
"no, sir, we’re not making nuclear weapons.
nobody — no, we’re not; we would never do a thing like that."
these are people that have deceived us.
they’ve lied to us.
they’re a terrorist state.
but — and i used to say it’s the worst deal that i’ve ever seen negotiated.
and by the way, just to finish prisoners.
so they’d come back; we get our prisoners.
but then when i hear the other day that now this deal is done.
it’s all done.
and now i hear they want to negotiate to get — and what do they say? they said very strongly, they said, "we are going to want a lot for the prisoners.
that’s out — we’re starting off; we’re going to want a lot."

now, we’ve already taken off the sanctions.
they’re already rich as hell.
what — what’s going on there? that’s why i say, i mean, some people say it’s worst than stupidity.
there’s something going on that we don’t know about.
i mean, honest.
and you almost think — i’m not saying that, and i’m not a conspiracy person.
as you said, "we are; we’re saying it."

half the people in this room are saying it.
i’m trying to be — you know, i’m just hoping they’re just stupid people, ok?
which they are.
or there’s something going on.
because it’s — it’s inconceivable.
you know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be — that nobody can do what they did, right? nobody.
which they are.
or there’s something going on.
because it’s — it’s inconceivable.
you know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be — that nobody can do what they did, right? nobody.
so, iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible).
in other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again.
and they want a lot.
"we want a lot." and i just — i want to just shoot the television, you know? because they would have had it just by saying.

and, you know, when they asked kerry and obama, the deal was made.
everybody knows it’s a horrible deal.
it’s going to need to — it’s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they’re so rich now.
you know, they became — $150 billion — they became so rich.
and many other things that you don’t even know about.
most people don’t even know what the agreement says.

 but i’ll tell you what, when you look at what we’re doing, we’re not going to have — if we keep going like this, folks, we’re not going to have a country left.
we’re not going to have a country.
we’re not going to have a country.
 but i’ll tell you what, when you look at what we’re doing, we’re not going to have — if we keep going like this, folks, we’re not going to have a country left.
we’re not going to have a country.
we’re not going to have a country.
and we’re like a dumping ground for the world.
we’re a dumping ground.
they want to take these migrants — the migrants, you know, and i feel terrible about the migration, caused by hillary clinton and barack obama.
they’re the ones that caused it.
they go into libya.
they knocked the hell out of gadhafi.
ok, so gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.

they knocked the hell out of gadhafi.
ok, so gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.
you know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom.
and then gets killed by the same people.
so, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than gadhafi.

look at what we did in iraq.
look at what we did in iraq.
i mean, what the hell did we get? we spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago.
i keep saying two or three, it’s a lot more than that.
we spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and i’m not even talking other side.

you are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.
you have thousands of deaths.
we have wounded warriors, who i love, all of.
these guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people.
you are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions.
you have thousands of deaths.
we have wounded warriors, who i love, all of.
these guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people.
 you know, these are the greatest people.
and then what happens? we leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving.
so, i said, man, if i’m the enemy, i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right?
 you know, these are the greatest people.
and then what happens? we leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving.
so, i said, man, if i’m the enemy, i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right?
he gave a date.
we are leaving iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time.
i said, i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying, man, that’s really stupid.
because, believe me, the enemy doesn’t want to be killed.
you know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?
he gave a date.
we are leaving iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time.
i said, i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying, man, that’s really stupid.
because, believe me, the enemy doesn’t want to be killed.
you know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?
they don’t.
they want to live.
and they want to take care of their families, always their families.
you remember that, because their families know what’s going on ok? you think their wives don’t know what they are planning? you think their kids don’t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the world trade center? you think they don’t know? they know exactly what’s going on.
remember that.
and frankly, i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives, ok.
but they still want to live.
so here is obama, gives an exact date.
he gives an exact date and so they pull back.
they don’t.
they want to live.
and they want to take care of their families, always their families.
you remember that, because their families know what’s going on ok? you think their wives don’t know what they are planning? you think their kids don’t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the world trade center? you think they don’t know? they know exactly what’s going on.
remember that.
and frankly, i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives, ok.
but they still want to live.
so here is obama, gives an exact date.
he gives an exact date and so they pull back.
and everyone says, oh, we are doing so well.
look, we’re doing so well.
why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? so what happens? so we have isis taking a lot of oil.
i said take the oil.
remember when we left, i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to destabilize the middle east.
and everyone says, oh, we are doing so well.
look, we’re doing so well.
why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? so what happens? so we have isis taking a lot of oil.
i said take the oil.
remember when we left, i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to destabilize the middle east.
because you had iraq and you had iran.
and i said, they fight, they’re always fighting for decades and decades, for generations.
they fight, that’s what they do.
they fight.
how we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe.
they fight and they were equal militarily.
they go this way, 10 feet.
they go this way, 10 feet.
then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again.

then saddam hussein throws a little gas.
everyone goes crazy.
oh, it’s because (ph) of gas.
they go back and forth.
it’s the same.
and they were stabilized.
and i said, if you go after one or the other, in this case iraq, you’re going to destabilize the middle east.
that’s what going to happen.
you’re going to destabilize the middle east.
and that’s exactly what happened.
we totally destabilized the middle east.
then saddam hussein throws a little gas.
everyone goes crazy.
oh, it’s because (ph) of gas.

that’s what going to happen.
you’re going to destabilize the middle east.
and that’s exactly what happened.
we totally destabilized the middle east.
we have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards.
you know iraq was horrible.
it was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in.
but we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out.
and we shouldn’t have given dates.
i mean, i would have probably said we are going to stay forever.
and they would have said, oh, man.
we have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards.

but we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out.
and we shouldn’t have given dates.
i mean, i would have probably said we are going to stay forever.
and they would have said, oh, man.
and then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy.
i mean, he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal.
but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back.
and then as soon as we left, they come in ok?
and then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy.
i mean, he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal.
but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back.
and then as soon as we left, they come in ok?
so they have the oil.
you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right? china.
always china.
i love china.
i love mexico.
their leaders are too smart for us.
we have no border.
we will build a wall.
mexico will pay for the wall by the way.
so they have the oil.
you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right? china.
always china.
i love china.
i love mexico.
their leaders are too smart for us.
we have no border.
we will build a wall.
mexico will pay for the wall by the way.
 we’re building a wall, we are going to have a border.
and people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process.
they’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.
 we’re building a wall, we are going to have a border.

they’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.
they are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process.
so, with iraq, so we give them the date and they take over.
we didn’t take the year.
so for four years, i have been talking about it.
then because of paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.
they are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process.
so, with iraq, so we give them the date and they take over.
we didn’t take the year.
so for four years, i have been talking about it.
then because of paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.
but i didn’t want to just bomb the oil.
i wanted to take oil.
they’re bombing.
you know, we are bombing.
great.
what’s going to happen after that? so we’re bombing.
and, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.
but i didn’t want to just bomb the oil.
i wanted to take oil.
they’re bombing.
you know, we are bombing.
great.
what’s going to happen after that? so we’re bombing.
and, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.
 i said, how could they keep selling it? obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere.
no, this is serious.
now think of it.
he talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old air force one, an old boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.

so, he’s got a problem with the carbon footprint.
you can’t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone.
i’m trying to figure out.
let’s see, i’m in my room in new york city and i want to put a little spray so that i can —
so, he’s got a problem with the carbon footprint.
you can’t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone.
i’m trying to figure out.
let’s see, i’m in my room in new york city and i want to put a little spray so that i can —
— right? right? but i hear where they don’t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which i really like better than going bing, bing, bing —
— right? right? but i hear where they don’t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which i really like better than going bing, bing, bing —
— and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you — it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my god, i’ve got to take a shower again.
my hair’s all screwed up, right?
— and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you — it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my god, i’ve got to take a shower again.
my hair’s all screwed up, right?
i want to use hair spray.
they say don’t use hair spray, it’s bad for the ozone.
so i’m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit — you know, i really do live in a very nice apartment, right?
i want to use hair spray.
they say don’t use hair spray, it’s bad for the ozone.
so i’m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit — you know, i really do live in a very nice apartment, right?
but it’s sealed, it’s beautiful.
i don’t think anything gets out.
and i’m not supposed to be using hair spray.
but think of it.
so obama’s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, ok? no, no, think of it.
i mean, even if you’re a believer in global warming, isis is a big problem, russia’s a problem, china’s a problem.
we’ve got a lot of problems.
by the way, the maniac in north korea is a problem.
he actually has nuclear weapons, right? that’s a problem.
but it’s sealed, it’s beautiful.
i don’t think anything gets out.
and i’m not supposed to be using hair spray.

that’s right, we don’t win anymore.
he said we want to win.
we don’t win anymore.
we’re going to win a lot — if i get elected, we’re going to win a lot.
we’ve got a lot of problems.

we’re going to win so much you’re all going to get sick and tired of winning.
you’re going to say oh no, not again.

but think of it.
so obama’s talking about all of this with the global warming and the — a lot of it’s a hoax, it’s a hoax.
i mean, it’s a money-making industry, ok? it’s a hoax, a lot of it.
and look, i want clean air and i want clean water.
that’s my global — i want clean, clean crystal water and i want clean air.
and we can do that, but we don’t have to destroy our businesses, we don’t have to destroy our —

and by the way, china isn’t abiding by anything.
they’re buying all of our coal; we can’t use coal anymore essentially.
they’re buying our coal and they’re using it.
now when you talk about the planet, it’s so big out there — we’re here, they’re there, it’s like they’re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.
miss universe, by the way, i made a great deal when i sold — oh did i get rich.

that was a great deal.
you know, they broke my choppers on that.
they said he talks about illegal immigration, we’re not going to put him on television.
first of all, univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldn’t believe it.
and nbc, i made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than i would have ever gotten — i mean, i made an unbelievable deal — far more than i ever would have gotten if i said i think i’m going to sell it if times were normal, right? isn’t it amazing the way that stuff can work out?

but i love miss universe and i love the universe.
but think of it.
so china is spewing up all this stuff and we’re holding back.
and with china — you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years.
i don’t think they’re going to be doing it.

it’s like japan.
if somebody attacks japan, we have to immediately go and start world war iii, ok? if we get attacked, japan doesn’t have to help us.
somehow, that doesn’t sound so fair.
does that sound good?
it’s like japan.

 so south korea — i order televisions, i order thousands of televisions a year.
i order televisions because i have a lot of stuff and i like nice brand new — they’re all made in south korea, most — other than sony, and sony, in all fairness, has lost its way.
but a lot of them — samsung, all of them.
i mean, they’re all pretty much — all of them, right? i think just about.
but i order thousands of televisions, they’re all from south korea.
so we have 28,000 people on the border separating south korea from this maniac in north korea, we get nothing.
what do — we get nothing.
they’re making a fortune.
it’s an economic behemoth.

we protect saudi arabia.
they were, during the good oil days — now it’s probably half, which is fine.
but during the good old — they were making a billion — listen to this — a billion dollars a day, and we protect them.
our military — they pay us peanuts, like nothing.
and then if we want to buy — we want to move to another location, well, that’s very expensive if we do that.
we want — they charge us rent?

i mean, look.
we are run by people that are so bad, they’re so out of their league — and i see it, i see it on the stage.
you know, they’re — a lot of them are nice people.
you know, a lot of people think i don’t like these people.
i do like them.
but they don’t have business sense, they don’t have business ability, they don’t have common sense.

when i say...
when i say...
...
folks, when i say, "we’re going to build a wall." most of them say, "you can’t build a wall — build a wall." in china 2,000 years ago, they built the great wall of china, which is bigger than any wall we’re thinking about, ok? the great wall of china goes 18,000 miles.
we have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across.
we have 1,000 miles.

made in america.
made in america.
even my hats, they’re made in america.
it wasn’t easy to find a guy that could do those hats.
you know what i’m talking about.
i see so many knock-offs of my hat, right? "make america great again." i see these things that are out of plastic.
they’re out of all sorts of crap.
mine are made in america.
and honestly, they do a great job, but they don’t produce as many as i’d like because, frankly, there’s a big — i mean, it’s amazing.
those hats are amazing.
but i wanted to have it made.
and you know why i wanted it — i wanted it, anyway, but i also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things — we have a website — as soon as the hats came out, i knew the press would be calling.
and it’s true.
first hour when the hats were announced, i get a call from the new york times.
"mr.
trump, where are those hats made?" i said, "america."

i knew it.
i knew it.
because as you know, if i would have said china, i would have been in big, big trouble.
but they’re being knocked off all over the world.
i mean, i see hats — they’re like helmets.
i see them all.
but what are you going to do?
i knew it.

but here’s the story.
we’ve got to build a wall.
so when i talk and when i’m up on the stage with these guys, these people — wonderful people — and a very nice woman, carly.
she’s a nice woman.
when i’m up on the stage with them, they think i’m crazy when i say "mexico" — i’m saying, "we’re going to build a wall; it’s going to be a great wall; it’s going to be real wall.
see this ceiling? this ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall i’m talking about."

all right? did you ever see what they do now? we have these little walls.
they build ramps.
they build a ramp.
i say, "wouldn’t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just..." and then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs.
do you see this? they build ramps.
there was a picture in time magazine.
it’s a ramp — a little ramp that goes over the wall.
so, they have a jeep — over, down, bump, make money.
we get the drugs.
think of it.
we — "build a wall" is right.

no so good, right? we don’t like that deal.
our politicians don’t know — they don’t know.
we get the drugs.
they get the cash.
no so good, right? we don’t like that deal.
our politicians don’t know — they don’t know.
so when i say "mexico’s going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, they’re not business people.
they don’t understand.
mexico makes a fortune off the united states.
number one, we give them a lot of money.
but in addition to that, they’re taking our businesses.
they’re making — you talk about a trade deficit.
i’ll tell you what, mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new china.
mexico is making an absolute fortune — peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.

let’s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion.
that’s a good — i can do great job at $10 billion.
i think we’ll have a lot of money left over.
somebody else would — and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall.
people that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall.
you know one of the reasons they didn’t build the wall? because of the environmental protection agency, they couldn’t get an environmental impact study approved.
can you believe it? because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.

now, think of it.
in china, in the south china sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top.
china sends in massive excavators and they’re (inaudible).
they’re building military fortresses in the south china sea.
and a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in china — he’s a great guy.
they’re great people.
they’re fine.
they’re just too smart.
i mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.

when they call up, "we’d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it." "no, no.
the donor now is carl icahn.
you’re going to speak to carl icahn." you know carl — great businessman.
you have so many people — they call all these business people — call.
so, a friend of mine, so i call him, i say, "you’re actually doing that." and then jokingly, i said, "how long did it take to get started? did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?"

they conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, ok? there is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail.
you’re going to hurt this.
you are going to — they are doing a big thing.

the biggest excavation.
they are ripping the hell out of that ocean.
they are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it — and they’re building air fields and they’re building forts.
they excavated — massive, massive — take a look, massive.
the biggest excavation.
they are ripping the hell out of that ocean.
they are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it — and they’re building air fields and they’re building forts.
we couldn’t do it because, just like i said for the law.
legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement.
now, that’s probably not the only reason it didn’t happen.
i heard their costs were too high.
with me, that’s easy.

i’m under budget, i’m ahead of schedule.
hey, look at the campaign.
the guy’s at $59 million and he’s down at the bottom.

 i actually said — it’s funny.
the other day i got this great review.
they said trump is a great speaker.
the crowd is spellbound.
but he has one problem.
and i’m reading, and i want to see.
the problem is, he speaks through the applause.
in other words, like i say that, you applaud, i start talking you finish your applause.
and you know why? because i’m so excited, because we have so much potential.
it’s true.

we have — i have so many — we have so much potential.
there are so many things to do.
i don’t really sort of want to wait.
i want to do it.
and i just noticed, i did it again.
you were getting ready to give a big applause, because you like that, and i’m speaking.
i killed the applause.
but he is right.

what i am is a doer.

 so, when the people up on the stage with me — and hillary, hillary doesn’t have a clue.
by the way, you talk about low energy.
she has lower energy than jeb bush, which is hard to believe.
she does.
and i’ll tell you and i’ve been saying it.
and maybe it’s rude, maybe it is not.
but it doesn’t matter.
we have a much bigger problem.
we have to save our country.

so, if i’m rude and if people think i’m rude — i’m actually a nice person.
i have a big heart.
i want to help people.
i want to help the migration.
i want to do a safe zone in syria.
i don’t want them coming here.
we don’t know who these people are.
they are undocumented.

we don’t know who these people are.

 and we should do a safe zone over there.
we should have the gulf states — saudi arabia and these states they are not spending.
they have got to spend.
they have to pay.
you know, we are protecting them.
we’re doing — they wouldn’t be there for two minutes if we weren’t protecting them.
they have to start paying.
they are not taking anybody, ok?

how about germany taking millions of migrants.
can you believe what she is doing to that country? and she was the person of the year and i wasn’t.
everybody said trump was supposed to.

(booing)
(booing)
hey, what are you going to do.
i think she has made a terrible mistake.
we will find out.
time will tell.
they have tremendous crime problems.
i think she has made a tremendous mistake.
but what i like is in syria, with other people’s money, meaning the gulf states and others and germany and others.

but what i like is in syria, with other people’s money, meaning the gulf states and others and germany and others.
because, look, germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people.
they’ll give us the money.
we do a massive safe zone.
and then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which i will probably be able to get it straightened out, i understand this now.

and then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which i will probably be able to get it straightened out, i understand this now.
but once it’s straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area.
it is interesting, i have thousands of people that work for me.
thousands.
and i have people that come from far — they are all here legally, don’t worry about it.
i use e- verify.
but i have people — oh, they go and check.
these guys go check.

they went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally? they said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds.
i don’t believe it.
but, you know, it is possible somebody slipped — hey, we do have 11 million people in the country.
and it is probably a much higher number than that, ok? it is probably a much higher number.

so, i just want to finish by saying this.
look, we have a situation that is out of control.
our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world.
we are laughed at by the rest of the world.

and when i started this journey, and it is a journey, and i do love you people.
you’re amazing people.
and by the way, you are so smart.
a lot of times, they will say, well mr.
trump’s people are blue-collar.
i love blue-collar.
i’m honored by that.

i love blue-collar.
i’m honored by that.
but they are not blue-collar.
we have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people.
they say the audience is old.
it’s not older.
the audience is young.
the other night in iowa, i told that, and i said, we have so many young people and the place erupted.
they are all young people.
we have an amazing thing happening, it’s just...
but they are not blue-collar.

 look, that’s their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you.
it is disgusting.
but when i started this journey and that’s what it is, it’s a journey and it’s a movement that’s taking place.
it’s a movement.
remember the old days? silent majority? it’s not right.
it’s a noisy majority.
people are angry.
it’s a noisy majority.
these aren’t silent people anymore.
i go to people — you can’t even hear.

i go to people — you can’t even hear.
this is an amazing thing that’s happened.
i received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that’s ok.
(inaudible) a couple of them, right? but, a guy who’s really respected, recently, and he said, "how does it feel?" i said, "how does what feel?" he said, "what you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the united states." i mean, even cnn said, "number one political story of the year is trump." you know what number two was? isis — isis was two.
i’d rather reverse it.
let isis be one; let me be two, because i want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.

make me number one next year.
but this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy.
he said — he said, "what you’ve done has never been done before in the history of this country." newt gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, "this is one the great phenomenons (ph) i’ve ever seen in politics; nobody’s ever seen it."

crowds like this? forget it.
i mean, it’s only confined to this (inaudible).
again, they sent 3,000 people home.
can you believe it? more than 3,000.
it’s — it’s unbelievable what’s happening.
it’s beautiful what’s happening.
it’s beautiful what’s happening.
but newt gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this.
crowds like this? forget it.

it’s — it’s unbelievable what’s happening.

it’s beautiful what’s happening.
but newt gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this.
but he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before." i said, "well, you know, it’s fine, but if i don’t win, it’s just a waste of time." he goes, "no, no, no.
what you’ve done is incredible." he said, "even if you don’t win, what you’ve done is incredible; you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics."
but he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before." i said, "well, you know, it’s fine, but if i don’t win, it’s just a waste of time." he goes, "no, no, no.

no, don’t applaud, don’t applaud, don’t applaud.
he said, "you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it’s forever going to be different.
your campaign — there’s never been anything like it." ok, he was very nice.
i said, "you don’t understand.
you don’t understand.
if i don’t win, i will consider this" — and i mean this — "a total and complete waste of time." i really do.
no, don’t applaud, don’t applaud, don’t applaud.
he said, "you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it’s forever going to be different.
your campaign — there’s never been anything like it." ok, he was very nice.
i said, "you don’t understand.
you don’t understand.
if i don’t win, i will consider this" — and i mean this — "a total and complete waste of time." i really do.
so — because we’re not going to do anything.
it’s wonderful.
oh, good, i had nice crowds.
they’ll write about me every once in a while; every two years i’ll have a story, "trump ran this rather good campaign." if we don’t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don’t win, it’s a terrible waste of time, because you’ll have somebody else in there.
they won’t be able to do what i do.
they’re not going to be able to.
and even if you get one of these republicans in, like, i didn’t finish the — so, the wall.
so — because we’re not going to do anything.
it’s wonderful.
oh, good, i had nice crowds.
they’ll write about me every once in a while; every two years i’ll have a story, "trump ran this rather good campaign." if we don’t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don’t win, it’s a terrible waste of time, because you’ll have somebody else in there.
they won’t be able to do what i do.
they’re not going to be able to.
and even if you get one of these republicans in, like, i didn’t finish the — so, the wall.
when i say "mexico is going to pay," they all laugh.
they all go "heh, heh, heh." they think it’s funny.
honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny.
they’re laughing.
you know, lightly, like "oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha." they’re going to pay for the wall, folks.
they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with mexico.
the wall is peanuts.
they’re going to pay for the wall.
when i say "mexico is going to pay," they all laugh.
they all go "heh, heh, heh." they think it’s funny.
honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny.
they’re laughing.
you know, lightly, like "oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha." they’re going to pay for the wall, folks.
they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with mexico.
the wall is peanuts.
they’re going to pay for the wall.
but i mention it, now they don’t laugh because they’re starting to agree with me.
and then the other day, one of the people said — it was ted cruz, who is a nice guy.
but he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." i said, "look" — and my wife is sitting (inaudible) — where did that come from, right? no, ted’s a good guy.
but i mention it, now they don’t laugh because they’re starting to agree with me.
and then the other day, one of the people said — it was ted cruz, who is a nice guy.
but he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." i said, "look" — and my wife is sitting (inaudible) — where did that come from, right? no, ted’s a good guy.
but he said on one of — i think it was on fox, he was being interviewed.
and he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." he didn’t say mexico was going to pay was going to pay.
he hasn’t gone that far yet, but believe me that’s going to happen.
see, they’re all trying to catch up with me.
because when i did this stuff, it was very out there.
but he said on one of — i think it was on fox, he was being interviewed.
and he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." he didn’t say mexico was going to pay was going to pay.
he hasn’t gone that far yet, but believe me that’s going to happen.
see, they’re all trying to catch up with me.
because when i did this stuff, it was very out there.
now, i’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to.
but what happens is — so ted’s up and he’s talking.
and, you know, routinely we’re going to have the border; we’re going to have this and that.
and we’re going to build a wall.
now, i’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to.
but what happens is — so ted’s up and he’s talking.
and, you know, routinely we’re going to have the border; we’re going to have this and that.
and we’re going to build a wall.
my wife is sitting there.
she says, "darling, did you hear that? he just said they’re going to build a wall.
that’s the first time i’ve — you know, that’s what you say." she hasn’t heard that from any other candidate.
my wife is sitting there.
she says, "darling, did you hear that? he just said they’re going to build a wall.
that’s the first time i’ve — you know, that’s what you say." she hasn’t heard that from any other candidate.
ok.
so we’re going to build a wall.
mexico is going to pay for it.
there are so many things we’re going to do.
but when i — when i started the journey, it was amazing.
i came down — it took courage.
i went down in to the lobby of trump tower, on the escalator with melania.
i have never seen — it looked like the academy awards, the press.
we have a lot of press here today.
they’re all live — look at all those live cameras.
ok.
so we’re going to build a wall.
mexico is going to pay for it.
there are so many things we’re going to do.
but when i — when i started the journey, it was amazing.
i came down — it took courage.
i went down in to the lobby of trump tower, on the escalator with melania.
i have never seen — it looked like the academy awards, the press.
we have a lot of press here today.
they’re all live — look at all those live cameras.
so when i came down — when i came down on the escalator, we came down.
and i said, "we’re going to do things." and i mentioned illegal immigration.
you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal — it wasn’t even on the radar.
nobody was talking about illegal immigration.
is that right? now, it’s one of the big subjects.
so when i came down — when i came down on the escalator, we came down.
and i said, "we’re going to do things." and i mentioned illegal immigration.
you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal — it wasn’t even on the radar.
nobody was talking about illegal immigration.
is that right? now, it’s one of the big subjects.
 and that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and i’m so proud of it, cnn just came out with a poll a couple of, i guess a week ago — 36 percent for trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12.
so they’re way down.
but on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent.
that’s with 16 people at the time.
 and that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and i’m so proud of it, cnn just came out with a poll a couple of, i guess a week ago — 36 percent for trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12.
so they’re way down.
but on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent.
that’s with 16 people at the time.
on the budget, i mean, i understand — the budget, the economy, i win — i win it hands down, all right.
on the budget, i mean, i understand — the budget, the economy, i win — i win it hands down, all right.
but listen to this.
on illegal immigration, i’m almost at 50 percent.
but listen to this.
on illegal immigration, i’m almost at 50 percent.
and on isis, likewise, almost at 50 percent.
so people want to be protected, they want to feel safe.
they need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts.
i don’t want to be tough — you know, i know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart, and they’re the — they’re the easiest.
you can be tough, you’ve got to be smart.
and on isis, likewise, almost at 50 percent.
so people want to be protected, they want to feel safe.
they need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts.
i don’t want to be tough — you know, i know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart, and they’re the — they’re the easiest.
you can be tough, you’ve got to be smart.
let’s start smart first.
you’ve got to be smart-tough.
you’ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us.
so what happens is this.
i came out, i started — i did it, i was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and mexico and all of this stuff.
then kate was killed in san francisco and jamiel was killed in los angeles.
jamiel shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant.
kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.
let’s start smart first.
you’ve got to be smart-tough.

kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.
so many great people.
and that’s — these are two, so many.
and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? and all of a sudden, people are coming over, and i say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall.
we have to be progressive in our thinking.
when i say progressive, i mean like smart.
i’m not talking progressive like a bernie sanders would say, the guy want to tax you.
think of it.
so many great people.
and that’s — these are two, so many.
and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? and all of a sudden, people are coming over, and i say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall.

when i say progressive, i mean like smart.
i’m not talking progressive like a bernie sanders would say, the guy want to tax you.
think of it.
think of it.
this guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent.
no, no, think — you’ll have to move out of this — i love this area, by the way.
i’ve been here many times.
great golfing area, right? we love it.
think of it.
this guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent.
no, no, think — you’ll have to move out of this — i love this area, by the way.
i’ve been here many times.
great golfing area, right? we love it.
no more golf if bernie sanders — no more golf.
no, no, you won’t have any golf anymore.
there won’t be — you won’t have any money left to be — you’ll be paying it in taxes.
this guy is a total disaster.
no more golf if bernie sanders — no more golf.
no, no, you won’t have any golf anymore.
there won’t be — you won’t have any money left to be — you’ll be paying it in taxes.
this guy is a total disaster.
and i’m not saying that — i’ll tell you why.
you know, hillary said well, i’d like to run against trump, believe me.
and i’m not saying that — i’ll tell you why.
you know, hillary said well, i’d like to run against trump, believe me.
this poor chuck todd, meet the press.
his show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but i never liked it.
you know, i just — he never treated me fairly.
so i do his show, he gets the highest ratings he’s had in years.
he went from, like — believe me, i won’t even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right? i saved his life, and then he goes hillary clinton said that she would most like to run against donald trump.
and yes — and they’re looking forward to it.
trust me, the last person — she’s already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?

so hillary clinton said — and here’s chuck todd — and he’s a nice guy.
i’m not trying to knock him.
please don’t be insulted, chuck.
but she says she doesn’t like him.
but he doesn’t treat me right.
so he goes the clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against trump, like i’m some kind of a sap.
so i call him and i say chuck, let me explain something.
when they say they want to run against me, that means they don’t want to run against me, do you understand that? do you understand it’s reverse psychology.

when they say they want to run against me, that means they don’t want to run against me, do you understand that? do you understand it’s reverse psychology.
they say they want to run against me — first of all, i’m winning and tied in the polls now and i haven’t even hit her yet.
but look at what happened to all the guys i hit.
they’re gonzo, they’re gone or they’re failing badly, ok, and they’ll be gone soon.
they say they want to run against me — first of all, i’m winning and tied in the polls now and i haven’t even hit her yet.
but look at what happened to all the guys i hit.
they’re gonzo, they’re gone or they’re failing badly, ok, and they’ll be gone soon.
but hillary clinton — think of it.
i say so chuck, report it like properly.
trust me, they don’t want to run against trump.
the last thing she wants in her whole life is — this was only — i did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband’s one of the great abusers of the world? give me a break.
give me a break.
but hillary clinton — think of it.

give me a break.
give me a break.
so the last person she wants to run against is me.
give me a break.
so the last person she wants to run against is me.
now here’s the story.
look, here’s the story.
it’s very simple.
so i announced — and i was talking about trade, i was talking about the wall, i was talking about the borders, i was talking about obamacare, i was talking about the 2nd amendment will be saved, by the way.
the 2nd amendment.
now here’s the story.
look, here’s the story.
it’s very simple.
so i announced — and i was talking about trade, i was talking about the wall, i was talking about the borders, i was talking about obamacare, i was talking about the 2nd amendment will be saved, by the way.
the 2nd amendment.
it will be saved.
the 2nd amendment is going to be with us if i’m president.
you know, they’re doing everything.
they want to get rid of the bullets now, they’re doing everything they can —
it will be saved.
the 2nd amendment is going to be with us if i’m president.
you know, they’re doing everything.
they want to get rid of the bullets now, they’re doing everything they can —
think of paris, think of los angeles.
think if you had some guns in paris on the good side, right? they had no guns.
paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks.
and france — i mean, you get caught with a gun, it’s — the only one that has guns are the bad guys.
so they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind.
he’s a moron.
i mean, this guy was a moron.
i call him the guy with the dirty hat, right? they got him so good.
by the way, the french police did a great job and our los angeles police did a phenomenal job.
they did a great job.
think of paris, think of los angeles.
think if you had some guns in paris on the good side, right? they had no guns.
paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks.

i call him the guy with the dirty hat, right? they got him so good.
by the way, the french police did a great job and our los angeles police did a phenomenal job.
they did a great job.
wouldn’t it be wonderful if, let’s see, this guy right here in front of me, he’s a tough guy.
this guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he’s a strong-looking guy right here.
this guy right there, see? and that one.
wouldn’t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist? somebody.
him, him, him, so that when they — you know what they were doing in paris? get over here, boom.
get over here, boom.
your turn, get over here, boom.
one hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals.
other people are going to die.

same thing over there.
these are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage.
there’s something going on, folks.
it’s wrong.
they gave them a party.
they worked — they gave them a party.
she came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.

she came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.
and people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs — who the hell doesn’t know? you’re their next door neighbor.
and they didn’t want to talk about it.
you’ve got to report these people.
we’ve got a real problem.
you’ve got to report them.
no more nonsense.

we’ve got a real problem.
you’ve got to report them.
no more nonsense.
they didn’t report them, and the reason they didn’t is because they don’t disagree with them so much.
ok? believe me.
it’s not because they were afraid.
you saw the one who wasn’t politically correct to (ph) report them.
they didn’t want to report them.
i mean, give me a break.
so we have to change.

so we have to change.
so it started off with me where i was going to talk about trade, i was going to talk about all the things, i was going to talk about the military, building it up.
i was going to do all of this, but after paris and california, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after paris and california, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.

it’s amazing.
they went up 10 points.
i said, "what, you think it was the debate?" because i did good in the debate.
they said, "no.
people view you as a tough cookie that’s not going to take this crap." that’s what it is.
it’s amazing.

i said, "what, you think it was the debate?" because i did good in the debate.
they said, "no.

and now i talk about protection.
i talk about — trust me.
the trade — that’s so easy for me.
i’ve got the greatest guys in the world.
they’re going to come in, they’re going to do a great job.
i’m going to do some myself.
i always talk about ford.
they’re going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in mexico.
that’s not going to happen with me.
that stuff is — those deals are no good.

ford’s leaving.
they’re closing plants all over michigan to build a plant in — in mexico.
how the hell does that help us? ok.
who are the people that think this is a good thing for us? and in the meantime, in michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they’re spending — think about a $2.5 billion — then they’re going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the united states, no tax, no nothing.

i’ll say you don’t have to pay a tax, folks.
and you know what? ford will say "if i (inaudible) pay a tax, we’re going to stay in the united states." i mean, it’s very simple.

how about two weeks ago, nabisco announced a big — chicago.
they announced they’re going to leave chicago with one of their big plants and they’re going to move it to mexico.
what’s my statement? we’re not eating oreos anymore, right? no more.

but i don’t want this.
it’s not going to happen.
then they’re make — they’re going to make product and they’re going to sell it into the united states? not going to happen.
it’s not going to happen.
and by the way, i’m a free trader.
i believe — we’ve got to be smart.

we don’t get anything out of anything.
we don’t get anything.

we lose on everything.
that iran deal was a disaster.
by the way, think of the iran deal for one second.
i always — and this came to me two weeks ago.
i don’t know why i didn’t think of it sooner.
very disappointed with myself.
we lose on everything.

the iran deal is the worst deal i’ve ever seen negotiated, ok? i’m wrong.
you know what the worst deal is? iran’s a part of that one too.
we gave them iraq.
that’s even better.
think of it.
we gave iran iraq.
iran has the biggest — think of it.
they’re going to have the richest oil — if you go to iraq, take a look.
among the largest oil reserves in the world.

they’re going to have the richest oil — if you go to iraq, take a look.
among the largest oil reserves in the world.
we gave them, by decapitating iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give iraq.
so not only did they make a great deal in terms of the iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them iraq.
we gave them iraq, that they’ve been after for 100 years.
we handed it to them.

so now, they have the largest oil reserves among — in the world.
that’s even better than the original deal.
i mean, whoever is representing iran is doing a hell of a job.
ok? if that was a stock, you’ve got to buy some.

it’s not going to happen.
we’re going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again.

"when mexico (meaning the mexican government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best.
they’re not sending you (pointing to the audience).
they’re not sending you (pointing again).
they’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us.
they’re bringing drugs.they’re bringing crime.
they’re rapists.
and some, i assume, are good people! but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting.
and it only makes common sense.
they’re sending us not the right people.
it’s coming from more than mexico.
it’s coming from all over south and latin america, and it’s coming probably from the middle east.
but we don’t know.
because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening.

what can be simpler or more accurately stated? the mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the united states.
they are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.
this was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in san francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the united states because they didn’t want him in mexico.
this is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the united states.
in other words, the worst elements in mexico are being pushed into the united states by the mexican

the largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are mexican cartels that arrange to have mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs.
the border patrol knows this.
likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.
the united states has become a dumping ground for mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.
on the other hand, many fabulous people come in from mexico and our country is better for it.
but these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally.
i am proud to say that i know many hard working mexicans—many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.

not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ...

i have great respect for mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit.
the problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.
to the citizens of the united states, who i will represent far better than anyone else as president, the mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade.
i have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something mexico doesn’t want me to say.
in actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that univision, previously my friend, went ballistic.
i believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the united states was of even more concern to the mexican government than my talk of border security.

i have lost a lot during this presidential run defending the people of the united states.
i have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for president.
macy’s, nbc, serta and nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.
univision, because 70% of their business comes from mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the mexican government.
the last thing mexico wants is donald trump as president in that i will make great trade deals for the united states and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.

interestingly, univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful ipo or high stock price—not to mention that i am currently suing them for breach of contract.
remember, univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of hillary clinton’s biggest backers.
after the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"—there was very little criticism.
it wasn’t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words.
if there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.

they have been through something that nobody could ever experience.
this is a very dark moment in america’s history.
a radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.

his father published support for the afghan taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty.
the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan.
the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.

yet hillary clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday.
and, guess what, she will probably say them.
she sort of has said them, but let’s see what happens.
she really has no choice, but she doesn’t want to.

however, she’s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words.
she supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what’s going wrong with our country and our borders.
she has no clue, in my opinion, what radical islam is and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know.
she’s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world — true weakness.

i don’t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before san bernardino, the slaughter, that’s all it was was a slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words "radical islam." here is what she said, exact quote, "muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism." that is hillary clinton.

so, she says the solution is to ban guns.
they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood.
her plan is to disarm law abiding americans, abolishing the second amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns.
no good.
not going to happen, folks.

the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into american and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing.
in fact, hillary clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life.
when it comes to radical islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss.
it’s deadly — totally deadly.

we need this information so badly, and he stopped it.

we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.
the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th.
nearly a year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama’s department of justice, state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states.
these departments refused to comply.
nobody even knows why.

take a look.
every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases.

truly our president doesn’t know what he’s doing.
he’s failed us and he’s failed us badly.
under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse.
and i’ve been saying that for a long time.
each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east.
our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.

in fact, clinton’s state department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.
having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country.
tell me, tell me – how stupid is that?

this could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was.
altogether, under the clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children.
not only their children, by the way, they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don’t know what’s happening.

the media talks about home grown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that’s a very, very important term — a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don’t like it.

this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth.

in san bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.
they said oh, "we thought so but we didn’t want to use racial profiling." which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don’t get in trouble.

trump: it also means we must change our foreign policy.
the decision to overthrow the regime in libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.

for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton’s war in libya.

i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel.
i am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish state.
good evening.
thank you very much.
i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel.
i am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish state.
in late 2001, weeks after the attacks on new york city, and on washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated...
and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalists, mayor rudy giuliani visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims.
i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent.

i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent.
in spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the gaza strip, i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state.
it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel, many people turned down this honor.
i did not.
i took the risk and i’m glad i did.

but i didn’t come here tonight to pander to you about israel.
that’s what politicians do.
all talk, no action, believe me.
i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother.
the only democracy in the middle east, the state of israel.

my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran.
i have been in business a long time.
i know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for america, for israel, and for the whole of the middle east.

i know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for america, for israel, and for the whole of the middle east.
the problem here is fundamental.
we have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.

we have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.
i’ve studied this issue in great detail.
i would say actually, greater by far than anybody else.
believe me, and it’s a bad deal.
the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has.
the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock.
and of course, they’ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.

the deal doesn’t even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability.
yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years.
but when those restrictions expire, iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad iran’s behavior is.
terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially israel.

when i’m president, i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran.
first, we will stand up to iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region.
iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if i’m not elected president, i know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that’s why i’m going to be elected president folks.
and we are leading in every poll, remember that please.

iran is a problem in iraq, a problem in syria, a problem in lebanon, a problem in yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for saudi arabia.
literally every day, iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states.
hezbollah, lebanon received, and i’ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and gps systems and rockets.
like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.

now they’re in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights.
in gaza, iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad.
and in the west bank they’re openly offering palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every palestinian terrorist’s home that’s been destroyed.
a deplorable, deplorable situation.
iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east, and it’s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.

secondly, we will totally dismantle iran’s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us.
iran has seeded terror groups all over the world.
during the last five years, iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents.
they’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home.
iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.

third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold iran totally accountable.
and we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before folks.
believe me.

and we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before folks.
believe me.
iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times.
those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten europe, and maybe someday hit even the united states.
and we’re not going to let that happen.
we’re not letting it happen, and we’re not letting it happen to israel, believe me.

do you want to hear something really shocking? as many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both hebrew and farsi, were the words "israel must be wiped off the face of the earth." you can forget that!

what kind of demented minds write that in hebrew? and here’s, you talk about twisted, here’s another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made! the deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate united nations security council resolutions.
the problem is, no one has done anything about it.
we will, we will, i promise we will.

which brings me to my next point.
the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations.
the united nations is not a friend of democracy.
it’s not a friend to freedom.
it’s not a friend even to the united states of america, where as you know, it has its home.
and it surely is not a friend to israel.
which brings me to my next point.

with president obama in his final year, yay! he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel, believe me.
believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.
with president obama in his final year, yay! he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel, believe me.
believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.
so with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine.
let me be clear.
an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster.
the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which i will use as president, 100 percent.

when people ask why, it’s because that’s not how you make a deal.
deals are made when parties come together.
they come to a table and they negotiate.
each side must give up something it values, i mean we have to do something where there’s value in exchange for something that it requires.
that’s what a deal is.
a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something.
that’s not going to happen with the united nations.
it will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize israel.
it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel.
it’s not going to happen folks.

and further, it would reward palestinian terrorism, because every day they’re stabbing israelis, and even americans.
just last week, american taylor allen force, a west point grad, phenomenol young person who served in iraq and afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding palestinian.
you don’t reward behavior like that.
you can not do it! there is only one way you treat that kind of behavior.
you have to confront it!

so, it’s not up the united nations to go with a solution.
it’s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves.
you have no choice.
they have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway.
the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don’t even really know what’s happening to israel, to anything in the area.
it’s so preposterous.
we’re not going to let that happen.
when i’m president, believe me, i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state.
it will be vetoed 100 percent.

you see, i know about deal-making.
that’s what i do.
i wrote ‘the art of the deal’.
one of the best-selling, all-time, and i mean seriously, i’m saying ‘one of’, because i’ll be criticized as though i say ‘the’, so i’m going to be very diplomatic.
one of...
i’ll be criticized.
i think it is number one, but why take a chance.

one of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.
to make a great deal, you need two willing participants.
we know israel is willing to deal.
israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years.
you had camp david in 2000, where prime minister barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous.
arafat rejected it.
in 2008, prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer.
the palestinian authority rejected it also.
then john kerry tried to come up with a framework and abbas didn’t even respond, not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america.
they didn’t even respond.

when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one.
and when i say something, i mean it.
i mean it.
i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately.
i have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region.

meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and hate the jews.
it has to stop.
when you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero’s, little kids want to be firefighters.
when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars.
in palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder jews.
we can’t let this continue.
we can’t let this happen any longer.

you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs.
glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace.
it is a horrible, horrible way to think.
it’s a barrier that can’t be broken.
that will end, and it’ll end soon, believe me.
in palestinian textbooks and mosques, you’ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they’ve got to go out, and they’ve got to start this educational process.
they have to end education of hatred.

there is no moral equivalency.
israel does not name public squares after terrorists.
israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians.
you see, what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.
and you see that happening all the time.
that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former secretary of state, hillary clinton, who is a total disaster by the way.
she and president obama have treated israel very, very badly.
but its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america.
we saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community.
it didn’t happen.

president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue, but it’s precisely the opposite that happened.
already, half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it’s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the united states.
we’ll get it solved, one way or the other.
we will get it solved.
but when the united states stands with israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially.
that’s what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states.

we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people, jerusalem.
and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally, the state of israel.
the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable.
they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel.
they must do that.
and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state.

to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.
and by the way, the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against and he’s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that’s what i do.

now i know some people say i’m too much of a fighter.
my preference is always peace, however and i’ve shown that.
i’ve shown that for a long time.
i built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always.
my goal is always again to bring people together.

and that’s why – why do you think she’s going along with these insane policies of his? okay? i mean, she goes along with everything.
so i think she’s going to be their nominee definitely.
the only question is whether or not she’ll be allowed to run.

china is building in the south china sea massive military bases.
right? why? they’re not supposed to.
they have no respect for obama or our country.
they’re not supposed to be doing that.
and you could get them to stop just by saying "we’re not doing business with you anymore." their whole economy would – you don’t have to go to war.
it’s economics.
the whole country would collapse in two seconds.
believe me.
we have such power and we don’t know it.

i think they’re using komatsu from japan...they have these massive escavators, and i said to a friend of mine who’s chinese from china – very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so i happen to like him, okay? – i said jokingly "how long did it take them to do these massive islands they’re building right out of the sea? boom, those shovels go in, take out everything.
how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?" he laughed.
he said, "what are you kidding me? nothing." they say "we will build there." about two seconds later, you have escavators digging.

it turned out to be true.
he didn’t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere.

so the enemy said "they’re going to leave on a certain date?" so they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened.

we actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 pacs.
the trump pac, the trump pac, the this pac.
first of all, i’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money.
some guy has no money.
he sets up a trump something pac.
nothing to do with me.
sets it up.
all of a sudden he’s got $2 million sitting there.
right? people send in money.
and that guy has no money.
how much of that money do you think he’s going to use to do what he’s supposed to be doing? that’s common sense.

"on her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake.
his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
‘oh well,’ she cried, ‘i’ll take you in, and i’ll take care of you.’ ‘take me in, oh tender woman.
take me in for heaven’s sake.

and now i’m in politics so i have to see people i wouldn’t normally...
so club for growth, they come up to my office.
this guy was i think a former congressman.
and he tells me a little bit about club for growth and i’m falling asleep.
and then he goes, "$1 million." and i said, "$1 million for what? i don’t even know you.
i’ve never met you." i said, "do me a favor." i’m trying to be nice and i said, "go back and write me a little note if you can." and he was stupid enough to write me a note.

he writes me a letter asking for $1 million.
i let him know that i’m not interested.
you could be rich.
i’d rather take a million and throw it all over this room.
i’d rather give it to you, to your boy.

...they write me a letter.
it’s like extortion.
they asked me for a $1 million.
i said no nicely.
and then they’re doing ads all over wisconsin.
club for growth.
they did it all over florida.
club for growth.

about eminent domain.
by the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn’t have highways, you wouldn’t have hospitals, you wouldn’t have bridges.
you need eminent domain.
if something’s in your way and you’re building a highway, if you’re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone’s property, every once in a while.

you know, it’s funny.
these guys all want the keystone pipeline.
right? everyone.
conservatives.
conservatives want the keystone pipeline.
i like the keystone pipeline too.
but they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn’t go 15 feet.

so, they don’t want eminent domain.
they do commercials about eminent domain.
they love the keystone pipeline, and the whole keystone pipeline is based around eminent domain because you’ve got to go from canada, where cruz was born, to texas, where he’s representing.
think of it.

but remember this.
if for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing – remember, i’m a good prognosticator, i’m a good predictor – the first thing that’s going to happen is the democrats are going to sue ted cruz.
he was born in canada.
he lived there for four years.
the head of the harvard law school, one of the top people in the business in terms of constitution, is saying that, you know, he’s wrong.
and we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that.
i’m going to win.

remember this.
if cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn’t get – because it’s all establishment.
you know, if i go into that whole mess of the convention, i’m not the establishment.
i don’t take their money.
i don’t hire their people.
i don’t do any of that stuff.
okay? so you have a disadvantage.

but if cruz wins, remember what i said.
just remember.
again, he’s not going to win.
but if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the democrats that he doesn’t have the right to be president.
and i think they’re right because he wasn’t born on our soil.
he wasn’t born.
he’s not a natural born citizen.

i don’t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody.
he is not a natural born citizen.
so if for some reason he should get the nomination, i really believe you’re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you’re going to have somebody that’s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit.

again, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a canadian citizen joint with u.s.
until 14 or 15 months ago.
did anyone know that? so he was a senator from texas, only because of the great sarah palin by the way, without sarah palin, he could have never won that election.
it was a fluke.
but he was a senator from texas.
he lived – he was a joint citizen.
now, he finally gave up his citizenship to canada like 16 months ago.
he said, "oh, i didn’t know i was a citizen of canada also." just like he didn’t know that goldman sachs and citibank gave him money.
i mean, this guy is – you just have to study him, folks.

that’s a little bit like what i’m doing.
i’m the least spent money.
you know, i’m funding my own campaign.
right? so, i don’t have a lot of the people coming to me.
you know, the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the united states, a lot of it isn’t really waste, fraud, and corruption.
it’s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the senate, people in congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they’re special interests and they do what those people want.
and that’s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack.
the military orders equipment they don’t even want and the stuff they do want they don’t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it’s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don’t want.

so the drug companies.
we are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the united states...which makes a lot of sense i guess.
but we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we’re going to end.
okay? we’re going to build a wall.

somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, "you’re out of work.
you’re out of job.

it’s over.
we’re moving to mexico." are crying.
grown men that have been there for a long time.

but with carrier...they’re coming across and they’re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from mexico – probably – we’ve probably given them subsidies.
they probably have the united states giving subsidies to move out of the country.
that’s how stupid it is and that’s how stupid we’re running...they said, "what would you do?" i say it’s very easy.
we call them.
we say let’s have a meeting.
here’s the story folks.
you’re moving to mexico.

you want to move to mexico, build your factory, it’s going to be wonderful.
hire your people they’re not from the united states.
all those people are now looking for jobs.
those are good jobs.
you know we’re hiring a lot of part-timers now...the numbers are totally phony.

so i say here’s what we’re going to do.
very simple.
you build your plant in mexico.
enjoy yourselves.
and you’re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the united states? no, you’re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner.
it’s true.

ppp 28% for trump, 26% for cruz.
in other words, it’s a little close here.
quinnipiac poll – very respected 31% for trump, 29% for cruz.
and then again cnn 33% to 20%.

and you know, there’s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, "are you going to vote for trump? he’s got very, very tough immigration policies.
he wants to destroy obamacare and replace it with something a lot better." i’m going to do that.
okay?

but you know, a lot of people, they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say, "uh, no i’ll vote for – " and then they’d get in the booth and they say, "trump is my man." there are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better.
but we’ll see because feb.
1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out.
you’ve got to do it.

you know, one of the groups in maine and it was like incredible.
we were in different places up in new england recently and new hampshire was amazing.

and then you hear the announcers.
"well, will they show up to vote?" and i don’t know much but i say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in tennessee, in texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in.
why aren’t they going to go and vote? or in your case caucus? why aren’t they going to go and vote? it’s sort of an amazing thing.
so we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?

but each time these geniuses would say, "well, he’s reached his plateau.
he’s plateaued" at 6%, right? then it goes to 11%.
"well, you know, this is surprising but he’s reached his plateau." and then it goes to 18%.
and then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%.
then it went actually 42% in the gravis poll and in reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that.
and then all of a sudden you didn’t hear so much about the plateau.

when you look at this crazy iran deal where we’re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don’t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means.
that’s not a good sign.
but they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the interpol.
these are bad dudes.
they get 14 plus seven so they’re getting 21 people.
and they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint.
right to do oil.

...two weeks ago i started.
i said, "wait a minute.

we gave them iraq.
we knocked the hell out of iraq.
we decimated their armed forces.
and you know, for years, they would fight.
for many, many years, for decades they’d fight, fight, fight.
nobody would win.

so, i started and i talked about the border.
very strong on immigration and illegal immigration.
took a lot of heat.
but you wouldn’t even be talking about that subject if i didn’t bring it up.
so, i started and i talked about the border.
very strong on immigration and illegal immigration.

and i talked about again i talked about isis and i talked about.
but what really happened is after paris we had 130 people killed.
and i talked about again i talked about isis and i talked about.
but what really happened is after paris we had 130 people killed.
and by the way, i told you common core is dead and second amendment is right this way.

we’re going to protect the guns.

you know, if in paris and if in los angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married.
she came on a fiancee permit...you know, wonderful fiancee.
she was totally radicalized.
maybe radicalized him.
maybe he was already that way.
but we’ve got to start thinking.
we have to start using our head.
bad stuff is happening.
we have to find out what’s going on.

but we’ve got to start thinking.
we have to start using our head.
bad stuff is happening.
we have to find out what’s going on.
we have a president who won’t even talk about the term.
if you think, he won’t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on.
and you can’t solve the problem if you don’t talk about it.
you have to talk about it.

if you think, he won’t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on.
and you can’t solve the problem if you don’t talk about it.
you have to talk about it.
so, very, very strongly we started talking about that.
and then after paris – and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world.
you can’t have a gun unless you’re bad guy, you bought a gun.
and they walked in just said "boom! boom! boom! you, move over.
boom!" killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded.

but if we had a couple of – few of the people that i pointed out – i could plenty in this audience, believe me.
but if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks.
it’d be a whole different story.

so very, very big on the second amendment.
but what happened is all of a sudden after paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in california, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked trump even more.
i went up 11 points.
i don’t want to do it for that reason.

but it went up because people want strength just like having the family of john wayne, who was great.
i love john wayne.
from iowa.
but out of nowhere i got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who’s an incredible woman, and she said, "we’d like to endorse you."

i mean, if you think of it, you can’t say "merry christmas" anymore.
we’re going to say "merry christmas" again.
you go into these department stores.
they don’t have any christmas displays.
they don’t have the sign "merry christmas".
even people that aren’t christian are saying "merry christmas.
we love christmas.
let us say ‘merry christmas’, happy holidays." but people like to see it.

so i said we’re going to do this and i had no idea it was going to work this way.
i figured i’d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse.
you know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out.
i had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally.

they didn’t mention at one of their meetings? i think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day.
they’d just say, "chris, tonight we’re closing up the george washington bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you." "oh, okay." they didn’t mention? nobody believes that.

so when chris talks about – when he talks about lack of experience – i built this incredible company.
i filed papers where everyone said "wow, that is unbelievable." i would have probably filed them even when i didn’t run because i built a great, great company.
tremendous cash.

everybody said "number one, he won’t run." and i ran.
i took a deep breath and i said, "let’s go" to my wife and we came down that escalator.

then they’d say well, they went to ivy league college.
so did i go to ivy league college.
they went to this.
most of them didn’t go to ivy league colleges by the way but they say they’re brilliant.
one’s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? like perry.

i filed form a.
but what happens is they say "well, he’ll never file form a." that’s basically where you sign your life away.
i filed form a.
then they said, "well, he’ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks." then they said, "and if he does, he’ll ask for many, many delays because you’re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever.
and they’ll delay it until after the election."

i built a great company and the reason – honestly worth billions and billions of dollars.
remember that – low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets – doral, trump tower, the trump building, big chunk of the bank of america building in san francisco, 1290 ave., land all over, land on the potomac, land all over.

and i told the story the other night for really the first real time.
but my wife said to me "you know if you run you will win.
don’t you?" she’s very smart.
i said, "what do you mean?" she said, "if you don’t run, you’re never going to poll before.
nobody believes you’re going to run." so if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren’t great before i announced.
she said, "no, the only way you’re going to get a poll number is you’ve got to announce." nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you’re running, it doesn’t matter.

so i said, "all right." i’m getting these lousy early numbers and i’m saying, "i don’t know.
i don’t want to run and find out it doesn’t work." i don’t want to be embarrassed like lindsey graham and all these guys who have nothing.
it’s true.

so we go down on the escalator.
you know what i did? you remember i took a deep breath because i’m telling you and you know what i’m talking about the press down there look like the academy awards.
there were so many cameras.
i have never seen anything like it.
the entire atrium of trump tower was packed with cameras and press.

i don’t know if that’s – but they said i’m the only celebrity.

…do i think that it’s time for some of the other republicans in the race that registering zero – in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which i assume is a mistake because that’s less than zero.
i assume that’s not happening.
do i think it’s time to have some of the other republican candidates drop out? yes.
there are too many people.
well, i don’t want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers.
look, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they’re at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out.

i think [scott] walker did a good thing.
i think the way walker – he saw it wasn’t happening, wasn’t going to happen and he just got out quickly.
you know, he was favored.

right? but he was favored for a period of time.

and one of the reasons that in my book i actually put financials in there – i showed some of the developments that – i have many, many more because you can only – simon and schuster – you actually kept me to eight or nine pages.
right? and there are four or five in a page.
but i show some of the great developments that i have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, i show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago.

we are run by people that are incompetent.
we are run by people who in so many words – i hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word.
unless they have bad intentions which i don’t believe they do.

like i mentioned corporate inversion.
the democrats want the money to come back.
who doesn’t? the republicans want the money to come back.
for three years, the democrats have said we want the money to come back.
for three years, the democrats and the republicans agree 100%.
you have a vast majority.
maybe everybody.
for three years.
guess what? they haven’t done anything.
right? they can’t even get along when they agree.

so here’s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can’t do it.
that’s a part of the problem.

…the question is should the fed raise rates? they are not raising them because obama has asked them not to raise them.
in my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen.
and in my opinion, janet yellen is highly political and she’s not raising rates for a very specific reason because obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn’t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration.
janet yellen should have raised the rates.
she’s not doing it because the obama administration and the president doesn’t want her to.
and if she does it, you see what happens every time there’s even a thought of raising them just a little bit.

and one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies.
because if you look at the devaluations of china, of japan, of many, many different countries, they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know how to say to china, "don’t do that.
don’t do that.
because if you do that, we’re going to put a big fat tax on you.
don’t do that." and you know what? if you said that, they wouldn’t do it.
if you have the right messenger…

so, simon and schuster came up to me.
they wanted to do a book.
they wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that’s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country.

what happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture.
and he did some great…photos.
i’m smiling.
i’m happy.
i look good.
everything was fine.
and then he took one where i wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture.
and then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture i had was that one.
it’s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture.
but when you’re talking about "crippled america" and you’re talking about all of the problems we have, i can’t have a big smiley face up there.
so that’s how we picked it.
we picked the worst photo taken of me.

and they called.
they did a story on me recently and it was a nice story.
and i said, i hope they don’t call this guy.
they ended up calling this guy "what do you think about trump?" and he said but in a respectful way, he said "he won because he was so damn unpredictable.
we don’t know what the hell he was going to do." that’s a positive.

but it was really – i said, "that’s not nice what he said." first, i said "that’s not nice.

he meant that as a compliment." and i called him.
i said, "what did you mean by that?" he said "i think that’s the greatest compliment i can pay.
we could not figure you out.
you came at us from 15 different angles."

so with obama, when he announces that we’re leaving iraq on a certain date, we shouldn’t have been there but once you announced the bad guys – you know how they say the surge worked? you know why the surge worked? you know why? because the bad guys all moved back.
they said, "hey, what do we have to get killed for?" i mean, these people don’t mind being killed, can you believe it? but they said "if we don’t have to, let’s not." so they moved back.

so the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, "oh, you’re leaving in a year.
going to have all the troops out.
let’s go back.
why do we have to be shot at for the next year? and what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he’ll change his mind and stay.
so let’s let him think he has this great victory with the surge." right? "the surge worked!"

if i don’t give the answer, i’m not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively.
so if i don’t give the answer, i’m not going to win." they’re going to say "trump wouldn’t give us the answer."

and i’ll tell you i read a number with, as an example, with ben.
ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money.
so when you read he has all this money, he’s paying a lot of money and that’s not reflected yet.
so when you hear they raised $20 million, they’re paying – now think of it, who pays – the number i actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so i’m telling you it may be off but you all know it’s a lot.

so when you hear they raised $20 million, they’re paying – now think of it, who pays – the number i actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so i’m telling you it may be off but you all know it’s a lot.
i think they said, 79 cents on the dollar.
think of it.
to raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be.
somebody is making a fortune.

i know in romney’s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars.
millions.
they became rich raising money.
it’s better than being a real estate broker.

now, in ben’s case, his super pac is running iowa.

in the case of jeb bush, you’re not supposed to deal with these super pacs.
okay? so, it was in the wall street journal the other day.
he has a super pac fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom.
did you read that? two ballrooms.
one here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course.
they’re not supposed to be coordination.
they’re not supposed to be talking.
they’re right next to each other.
and that’s nothing compared to what some are doing.

and what happened and i haven’t talked about this before but i’m seeing what’s going on.
it’s horrible what’s going on.
what happened is the last time they had the super pacs, i actually think there was sort of a wall.
you know, they called it the wall.

i mean, even though like bush has a friend of his running his super pac, i’m sure they never talk.
i’m sure.
what do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%.
i’d say 100%.
i’d say 100%.
only a foolish person would say 99%.
but whatever.

i mean, had walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the super pac but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they’re all doing.
that’s why he’s out of the race because he couldn’t figure it out.

the whole thing with super pacs is a horrible, horrible scam.
so i sent letters last week to as many as we could find.
they’re all over the place.
we want you to close the super pac.
we want nothing to do with it.
we don’t want to get advertisements.
we don’t want any of the money.
go home and ideally give the money back.
they don’t even have to give the money back from what i understand.
they can keep it.
they’ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they’ll say "what a horrible thing he just said.
i think we’re going to support somebody else." they could do that.

and what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left.
when you read that ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign.
you’ll be amazed.
i mean, it’s so little.

and just remember when i have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when i have to do that, you know, john deere, i paid them tens of millions of dollars.
you can even check.
i said to john deere, "i want an endorsement." i don’t know if they’ll give me an endorsement.
i’ll tell you if they don’t they’re not so smart.
i guarantee no other person gave john deere – i mean, i bought probably more than $10 million worth of john deere equipments.
i love it.
you know why? iowa.

i think i’m the only one that’s self-funding.
i’m the only one putting up my own money, other than – i know it’s precious – people write in to donaldjtrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20.
i keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100.
i don’t want their money.

and something i’m very proud of that i think it’s great and it’s you know really great, it hasn’t gotten very much publicity, hasn’t gotten much publicity, but i have spent less money than any other candidate.
okay? by far.
i think.
i don’t know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around…but i was told that i spend less.
and i have the best results because in most polls i’m number one.

right? come on.
…you know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.
…you know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.
now, you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness.
but still, we have 50 million.
we have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps.
46 million.
think of it.
you know, we talk about how well we’re doing.

but still, we have 50 million.
we have 46 million people and they’re getting food stamps.
46 million.
think of it.

so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it’s got to end.
so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it’s got to end.
one of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country.
it’s very simple.
you know, it’s so simple when you think about it.

it’s very simple.
you know, it’s so simple when you think about it.
our jobs have been taken away.
our jobs have been taken away.
and i’ll tell you what else, middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years.
people are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago.
and other things have gone up.
so they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago.

but that’s an amazing stat.
but that’s an amazing stat.
but people – one of the reasons they say i’m doing so well because i let people know we’re going to bring jobs back.
we’re going to bring industry and plants.
we’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that.
we’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working.

then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs.
i have some people that i know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place.
all of a sudden they’re working part-time because of obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better.
they love the owners, the stores and things.
they love the owners; they think the owners are great.
but the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs.
they work all their life.
they have a wonderful company that they’re working for, and now all of a sudden they’re cut into part-time jobs because of obamacare because of the rulings of obamacare.
and you all know what i’m talking about.

so they end up being part-time workers and they don’t want to be part-time workers.
they don’t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker.
and we’re not going to have that stuff anymore.
we’re not going to have it any more.

we’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up.
believe me.
the numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame
…tell you what, as president, i can guarantee it.
as trump, i can say i’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop.
it’ll be easier to take todd and just say, "look, we’re going to work with you, todd.
okay?" so will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here? you have problems with the va also, huh? terrible?

the waits now for the va are longer than they’ve ever been…the waits now are worse than they’ve ever been.
thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor.
okay, dying.
the waits now for the va are longer than they’ve ever been…the waits now are worse than they’ve ever been.

you know, the funny thing about the apprentice – there have been 15 copies of the apprentice.
every single one of them failed.
so then a reporter said to me, "why do you think that is?" i said "because i’m special." and i was kidding.
i was doing it sarcastically – i mean, i sort of meant it to be honest, right? but i was sort of kidding.
and they wrote it and i hated the way it looked in writing.
you know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing.

but so i had a great experience.
so here i am – great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do the apprentice, tremendous success.
when i did the apprentice, a certain critic said "it will never be successful" because you know to have a big hit – a really a number one hit – you have to – and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever.
the finale of the apprentice? aye! remember with the great bill rancic.
remember how that was? incredible.
but to have a great success, you have to have women.

they left a couple of hours difference.
one took air force one; one took a beautiful boeing 757.

a little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows.

then they see all these companies.
and you know, they have boxes.
and because it wasn’t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes.
they say, "is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?" the last box is $50 million or more.

i think there’s 23 of them.
can you believe it? so i checked like, i don’t know, i think it’s 23.
i could be wrong.

that’s a big wall.
that’s serious wall, right? this was 2,000 years ago.
i mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, i got to be a little bit – you know, took a long time.

caterpillar’s stock is down.
it’s terrible.

she's going to pay it at the polls.
i believe that.
on top of everything else, hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time.
she's totally owned by wall street.
we believe in americanism; she believes in globalism.
and it's not that she believes in it.
the people that give her all of this money believe in it.
and she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe.
believe me.
that's it.

hillary clinton's foreign policy helped launch isis.
you know, she's talking — i see the ads she puts on.
if i make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests.
got a lot of money.

got a lot of money.
but i see the ads on foreign policy.
she's talking about donald trump doesn't have foreign policy experience.
of course not.
i've been a very, very, very successful businessperson.
i mean — but — but if you look at my calls, i said, don't go into iraq.
nobody cared, because i was a businessperson.
i was a civilian.
take the oil.
many, many calls i've made.

you take a look.
i said that in scotland and in the u.k., that was going to happen.
i was the one that predicted it.
and everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong.
president obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because i consider it a win.
i think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do.
and they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.

and i said that brexit's going to happen.
i said that they are going to break away.
and everybody laughed at me.
and the odds were 20 percent.
and then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, donald trump said this or that, but i'm the one that said it was going to happen.
and some of the more fair reporters — about 30 percent of them — said he was right.
i appreciate that.
seventy percent didn't, so that's ok.

so mike pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy.
so important.
now, i think if you look at one of the big reasons that i chose mike — and one of the reasons is party unity, i have to be honest.
so many people have said party unity.
because i'm an outsider.
i want to be an outsider.
i think it's one of the reasons i won in landslides.

there were 17.
we got — i say we, because i'm the messenger, i'm a messenger — i'm doing a good job, but i'm a messenger — we got almost 14 million votes.
that's more than any other person in the history of the republican party in the primary system running for president.

but i mean by a lot.
i don't mean by a little.
but that's with 17 people.
people don't over-say that.
that means our message is unbelievable.
and i want to thank all of the loyal people — because i have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.

it was on display, where we had this group of people, who — many of whom i've known, and i won't say, because for party unity, i'll say they're wonderful people, ok? never trump, they said, never trump, never trump.
oh, we're going to win.
they got crushed.
and they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.

they're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start — and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers.
we're going to put them back to work.

so they're very tired of it.
but i want to thank all of those people that — delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something.
did we show them something.
and unfortunately, the vote was very late.
but essentially, we had 112- 12.
this was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight.
we're not going to have a fight.

and what we're doing...
and what we're doing that i'm so proud of, so proud — and nobody else would even think about doing it — i fought very hard for it.
we'll call it the johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals — and i want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, i could not have won this nomination.
the evangelicals have been unbelievable.
i dominated with the evangelicals.
a lot of people were surprised.
they say he's not perfect.
but you know what? they know i'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart.

you have the johnson amendment passed by lyndon johnson and his group.
and he was a powerful president.
he knew how to get things done.
he got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him.

we put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible johnson amendment.
and we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let christians and jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.

i saw this.
i had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top — the absolute top evangelical leaders, christian leaders, jewish leaders, believe it or not, some muslim leaders — people are going to be surprised to hear that — i had the top leaders up to my office, and i said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?

and they didn't know how to answer the question.
and it took two, three meetings before i figured it out.
one great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name i will not reveal, said, mr.
trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues.
we live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.

and i looked out the window.
i was in trump tower, and i pointed to people walking down the street.
i said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't.
that means they're more powerful than you are.
we have to do something about it.

and he actually had a problem in texas with a certain religious leader.
and he did this, and he got it done.
and we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away.
and we're going to change that.
ok? all right.

back to mike pence.
so one of the primary reasons i chose mike was i looked at indiana, and i won indiana big.
remember, indiana was going to be the firewall.
that's where trump was going to — they agreed i'd win new york, i'd win pennsylvania, i'd win all these places.
but indiana was going to be the firewall.

under governor pence's leadership, indiana enacted the largest k- 12 education funding increase in the state's history.

i build infrastructure.

we're building — we're building — i won the — which is pretty amazing with the obama administration, but i won the right to have the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue, right near the white house, and it's an amazing — probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the gsa, general services.
and i really like what's happened.

but i thought the other day, i was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year — actually more than a year — we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially.
and the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.

so when i see what happened to indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when i see what happened to indiana under mike's work — also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at duke — who's now at purdue — when i see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened — almost has not happened in this whole country.

the turnaround and the strength of indiana has been incredible, and i learned that when i campaigned there.
and i learned that when i won that state in a landslide.
and i learned that when governor pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember.
he talked about trump, then he talked about ted — who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, ted cruz, good guy — but he talked about trump, ted, then he went back to trump.
i said, who did he endorse?

thank you, everybody.
thank you.
all right.
let's turn that music down.
we want to get to business, right? get to business.
how is your governor doing, by the way? good? i think so.
i think so.
i just want to thank all of the people of indiana.
you know, we had a great victory here not so long ago.
and indiana was the state that put me over the top.
thank you, folks.
thank you.
[ cheering ] well, we have a lot of things to discuss, but we had some very bad news a few days ago, and you saw what happened.
a lot of bad things are happening.
and i was going to go through a whole litany of that, but we don't want to.
we want to be upbeat.
we want to be positive.
we want to be strong.
and we're going to be strong.
we're going to be stronger than ever before.
we're going to be greater than ever before.
we're going to bring our jobs back.
we're going bring our military back.
it's being depleted so badly.
we're going to take care of our veterans, which we have to take care of.
we're going to get rid of obamacare, which is a disaster.
[ cheering ] and replace it with something terrific.
we end common core.
we bring our education back to the local communities like this local community where the people love their children and they want to see their children be well educated.
it's so important.
we're going to save our second amendment.
we're going to save our second amendment.
and it's under siege.
you know, i wrote a few words today.
and i think it's important that we go through it as a group.
it's been a special place and you're special people.
and i know so many people tonight in the audience.
and you're all over.
look at all those cameras up there, folks.
look at all those cameras.
they don't stop.
they don't stop.
but i just wanted to say i wrote this quickly, but it means it came right from the heart.
and i have to say that our whole nation grieves and mourns for the loss of five heros in dallas, law enforcement.
these were great, great people.
great people.
[ applause ] we pray for their families.
we pray for their loved ones.
we pray for all the wounded survivors.
we pray for our country.
it's so important.
the police are not just part of our society.
our police are the best of our society.
remember that.
we have to remember that.
they represent our highest ideals, our greatest values, and our most noble characteristics.
when our police are attacked, our entire nation is attacked.
remember that.
remember that.
so the message must be delivered clearly for all to hear, the hostility against our police has to end, and it has to end right now.
and we have to say together, and we have to be strong.
we have to take care of everyone.
the two people that were killed in louisiana and minnesota, it was tough.
it was tough to watch for everybody here it was tough to watch.
we have to figure it out.
we have to figure out what is going on.
was it training? was it something else? it could have been something else.
we have to take care of everybody.
remember that.
but we have to also -- we have to get to the bottom of things.
we have to.
but we can never, ever forget the hundreds of thousands of great deals and great things that our police all over the country do, and nobody recognizes them for what they do.
and when there is a problem, as bad as these two situations were, and i personally think they were, they were bad.
i hated, i hated watching it.
but as bad as they were, they get broadcast all over the world for days and days, and all of the good things which are magnified thousands of times, nobody talks about.
so we have to remember, we have to cherish and take care of our police.
if we don't, if we don't, we don't have a country anymore.
we have a country in chaos.
and remember this.
and i say it once, and i say it with love, and i say it with compassion.
because i have love for our country, and i have great compassion for our people in our country.
but i am the law and order candidate.
we need law and order, and we need strength in this country.
we don't have strength in our country.
we have crooked hillary clinton, as crooked as you get.
i mean, you saw that with the e-mails.
it's a rigged system, folks.
it's a rigged system.
just remember it.
it's a rigged system.
it's rigged in so many different ways.
we're going to straighten it out.
you can't even watch what happens.
we had a young man who did nothing by comparison to what she did, and he warned his friends of a problem that was coming militarily.
and they came down on him with a vengeance.
and they let her go.
33,000 missing e-mails.
they let her go.
lies all over the place.
and they let her go.
think of it.
it's a disgrace.
so we're going to get on to other subjects.
but i have to say law enforcement has to remain with us.
we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement officials.
we're going to do it.
we're going to continue to do it.
we're going remember that they do a fabulous job.
we're going to remember that they do a great job.
and every once in a while, problems will happen.
and we're going take care of those problems.
and they can be bad problems.
but we are going to treat our police with respect.
remember that.
okay? now i'm looking at different rates and different crimes.
and you see the crime rate in large portions of our country is going way up.
you look at certain inner cities, and look at chicago.
look at what is going on.
since president obama became president, almost 5,000 killings in chicago.
and nobody talks about it.
well, we're going to start talking about it.
because we have to make this a safe country.
and, you know, i would say two weeks ago, a month ago, i wouldn't be saying these words.
i was talking about the border.
i was talking about the wall.
and we will build the wall.
that i can tell you.
i can tell you.
we're going to build it.
don't worry about it.
are you ready? who is going to pay for the wall?
wow.
wow! [ cheering ] whoa! that's a lot of people.
that's a lot of people.
thank you, everybody.
